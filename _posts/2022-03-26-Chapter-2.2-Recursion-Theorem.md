We wish to answer the following question: Suppose we are given a set \\( A \\), an element \\( a\in A \\), and a function \\( F:A\to A \\). Can we find a function \\( h:\omega\to A \\) such that (1) \\( h(0)=a \\) and (2) \\( h(n^+)=F(h(n)) \\) for all \\( n\in \omega \\)? 

Consider the following proposal: We can let

\\[ h=\\{<n,F^n(a)> \ \vert \ n\in \omega\\} \\]

where \\( F^n=\overbrace{F(F(\cdots}^{n\text{ times}}(a))) \\) with \\( F^0=a \\). Clearly \\( h(0)=a \\) and \\( h(n^+)=F(F^n(n))=F(h(n)) \\), so this function satisfies the requirements. The problem with this proposal is that it is not entirely clear if we can explicitly construct the set \\( h \\). If we could, that would mean that we can encode the idea of recursion within set theory. This is possible to do, but to show why is not an easy task.

> Theorem 2.2.1 [Recursion Theorem] Let \\( A \\) be a set, \\( a\in A \\), and \\( F:A\to A \\). Then there exists a unique function \\( h:\omega\to A \\) such that \\( h(0)=a \\) and \\( h(n^+)=F(h(n)) \\) for all \\( n\in \omega \\).

Proof. For the purposes of this section only we shall call a function \\( v \\) acceptable if \\( \text{dom }v\subseteq \omega \\) and \\( \text{ran }v\subseteq A \\), and the following holds:

- If \\( 0\in \text{dom }v \\), then \\( v(0)=a \\).
- If \\( n^+\in \text{dom }v \\), then \\( n \\) is also in \\( \text{dom }v \\) and also \\( v(n^+)=F(v(n)) \\).

We can form the collection \\( \mathcal{K} \\) of all possible acceptable functions. This can be done by filtering out what we want from the collection of the subsets of \\( \omega\times A \\), i.e, \\( \mathcal{P}(\omega\times A) \\). Our claim is that \\( h=\bigcup \mathcal{K} \\). Notice that this means \\( <n,y>\in h \\) iff \\( v(n)=y \\) for some \\( v\in \mathcal{K} \\).

We need to show 4 things: (1) \\( h \\) is a function, (2) \\( h \\) is acceptable, (3) \\( \text{dom }h=\omega \\) and (4) \\( h \\) is unique.
