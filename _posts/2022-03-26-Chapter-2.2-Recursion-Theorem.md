We wish to answer the following question: Suppose we are given a set \\( A \\), an element \\( a\in A \\), and a function \\( F:A\to A \\). Can we find a function \\( h:\omega\to A \\) such that (1) \\( h(0)=a \\) and (2) \\( h(n^+)=F(h(n)) \\) for all \\( n\in \omega \\)? 

Consider the following proposal: We can let

\\[ h=\\{<n,F^n(a)> \ \vert \ n\in \omega\\} \\]

where \\( F^n=\overbrace{F(F(\cdots}^{n\text{ times}}(a))) \\) with \\( F^0=a \\). Clearly \\( h(0)=a \\) and \\( h(n^+)=F(F^n(n))=F(h(n)) \\), so this function satisfies the requirements. The problem with this proposal is that it is not entirely clear if we can explicitly construct the set \\( h \\).
