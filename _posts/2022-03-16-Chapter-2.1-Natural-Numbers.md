We have been using numbers without first properly defining them in a set-theoretic manner. This will change as of right now. After a series of posts, you will hopefully be convinced that numbers can and do exist in a set-theoretic universe, and by numbers I mean sets which behave the way we want them to (with regards to arithmetic).

We shall define numbers recursively as follows:

1. The empty set, \\( \varnothing \\) is a number
2. If \\( n \\) is a number, then the next number, \\( n^+ \\) is given by: \\( n^+=\\{n\\}\cup n \\)

For example, the next number after \\( \varnothing \\) is 

\\[ \varnothing^+=\\{\varnothing\\}\cup \varnothing=\\{\varnothing\\}. \\] 

The number after \\( \varnothing^+ \\) is 

\\[ \varnothing^{++}=\\{\\{\varnothing\\}\\}\cup \\{\varnothing\\}=\\{\\{\varnothing\\},\varnothing\\}. \\] 

and so on... we can keep going and going. Instead of using \\( \varnothing, \ \varnothing^+, \ldots \\) to label our numbers, we use something more familiar instead: \\( 0,1,2,\ldots \\). I.e, we have the relabelling:

\\[ \varnothing=0, \quad \varnothing^+=1, \quad \varnothing^{++}=2,\quad \cdots \\]

> Theorem 2.1.1 If \\( n\neq 0 \\) is a number, then it contains the number before it. The number before it is also a subset of \\( n \\).

Proof. Since \\( n\neq 0 \\), there exists a number before it, call it \\( b \\). Then we must have \\( b^+=n \\). The objective now is to show that \\( b\in b^+=\\{b\\}\cup b \\). This is trivial.

Now onto the second part: There is a number, \\( b \\) before \\( n \\). Our objective is to show that \\( b\subseteq b^+=\\{b\\}\cup b \\). This is also trivial. \\( \Box \\)

The first part of Theorem 2.1.1 tells us:

\\[ 0\in 1\in 2\in 3\in \cdots \\]


The second part tells us:

\\[ 0\subseteq 1\subseteq 2 \subseteq 3 \subseteq \cdots \\]

Combining the two theorems above give us 

> Corollary 2.1.1.1 If \\( n\neq 0 \\) is a number, then it contains all the numbers before it.

Proof. Let \\( b \\) be a number that is before \\( n \\), then

\\[ b\in b^+\subseteq \cdots \subseteq n. \quad \Box \\]

In fact, a number precisely contains all the number before it and nothing else. For example: \\( 2=\\{0,1\\} \\) and \\( 5=\\{0,1,2,3,4\\} \\).
