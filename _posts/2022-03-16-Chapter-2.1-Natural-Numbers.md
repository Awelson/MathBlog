We have been using numbers without first properly defining them in a set-theoretic manner. This will change as of right now. After a series of posts, you will hopefully be convinced that numbers can and do exist in a set-theoretic universe, and by numbers I mean sets which behave the way we want them to (with regards to arithmetic).

We shall define numbers recursively as follows:

1. The empty set, \\( \varnothing \\) is a number
2. If \\( n \\) is a number, then the next number, \\( n^+ \\) is given by: \\( \\{n\\}\cup n \\)

For example, the next number after \\( \varnothing \\) is \\( \varnothing^+=\\{\varnothing\\}\cup \varnothing \\). The number after \\( \varnothing^+ \\) is \\( varnothing^{++}=\\{\\{\varnothing\\}\\}\cup \\{\varnothing\\}=\\{\\{\varnothing\\},\varnothing\\} \\).
