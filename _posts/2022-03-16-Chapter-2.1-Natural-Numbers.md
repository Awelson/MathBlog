We have been using numbers without first properly defining them in a set-theoretic manner. This will change as of right now. After a series of posts, you will hopefully be convinced that numbers can and do exist in a set-theoretic universe, and by numbers I mean sets which behave the way we want them to (with regards to arithmetic).

We shall define numbers recursively as follows:

1. The empty set, \\( \varnothing \\) is a number
2. If \\( n \\) is a number, then the next number, \\( n^+ \\) is given by: \\( n^+=\\{n\\}\cup n \\)

For example, the next number after \\( \varnothing \\) is 

\\[ \varnothing^+=\\{\varnothing\\}\cup \varnothing=\\{\varnothing\\}. \\] 

The number after \\( \varnothing^+ \\) is 

\\[ \varnothing^{++}=\\{\\{\varnothing\\}\\}\cup \\{\varnothing\\}=\\{\\{\varnothing\\},\varnothing\\}. \\] 

and so on... we can keep going and going. Instead of using \\( \varnothing, \ \varnothing^+, \ldots \\) to label our numbers, we use something more familiar instead: \\( 0,1,2,\ldots \\). I.e, we have the relabelling:

\\[ \varnothing=0, \quad \varnothing^+=1, \quad \varnothing^{++}=2,\quad \cdots \\]

> Theorem 2.1.1 If \\( n\neq 0 \\) is a number, then it contains the number before it. The number before it is also a subset of \\( n \\).

Proof. Since \\( n\neq 0 \\), there exists a number before it, call it \\( b \\). Then we must have \\( b^+=n \\). The objective now is to show that \\( b\in b^+=\\{b\\}\cup b \\). This is trivial.

Now onto the second part: There is a number, \\( b \\) before \\( n \\). Our objective is to show that \\( b\subseteq b^+=\\{b\\}\cup b \\). This is also trivial. \\( \Box \\)

The first part of Theorem 2.1.1 tells us:

\\[ 0\in 1\in 2\in 3\in \cdots \\]


The second part tells us:

\\[ 0\subseteq 1\subseteq 2 \subseteq 3 \subseteq \cdots \\]

Combining the two theorems above give us 

> Corollary 2.1.1.1 If \\( n\neq 0 \\) is a number, then it contains all the numbers before it.

Proof. Let \\( b \\) be a number that is before \\( n \\), then

\\[ b\in b^+\subseteq \cdots \subseteq n. \quad \Box \\]

In fact, a number precisely contains all the number before it and nothing else. For example: \\( 2=\\{0,1\\} \\) and \\( 5=\\{0,1,2,3,4\\} \\). Try to convince yourself of this fact.

### Inductive Sets

We say that a set \\( A \\) is inductive if \\( 0=\varnothing\in A \\), further, if \\( a\in A \\) we must have \\( a^+\in A \\) (where \\( a^+=\\{a\\}\cup a \\), borrowing the notation from before). With the axioms we have currently, we cannot prove that an inductive set exists. To mitigate this problem, we create an axiom that guarantees the existence of an inductive set:

> Infinity Axiom. There exists an inductive set:
- \\( \exists A \ [\varnothing \in A \ \land \ (\forall a\in A)a^+\in A] \\)

We call it the infinity axiom because any inductive set has (at minimum) infinite members, it contains:

\\[ \varnothing, \quad \varnothing^+, \quad \varnothing^{++}, \quad \cdots \\]

and so on. We exploit this property to provide a formal definition for what a number is:

> Definition. A set, \\( n \\), is a number if it is contained in every inductive set. In other words: \\( \forall A \ [A\text{ is inductive } \Longrightarrow \ n\in A] \\).

We now show that a set, \\( \omega \\), consisting precisely of all numbers exists.

> Claim. \\( \omega \\) exists. 

Proof. Let \\( A \\) be an inductive set. We know \\( A \\) exists by the infinity axiom. It is clear that \\( \omega\subseteq A \\), so all we have to do is filter all the number from the set \\( A \\). We can do so with the axiom of specification: Let

\\[ \omega=\\{ x\in A \ \vert \ x \ \text{is in every inductive set} \\}. \quad \Box \\]

Of course,

\\[ \omega=\\{\varnothing, \varnothing^+, \varnothing^{++}, \ldots\\}=\\{0,1,2,\ldots\\}. \\]

Now we will show that \\( \omega \\) itself is inductive.

> Theorem 1.2.2 \\( \ \omega \\) is inductive. 

Proof. Clearly \\( \varnothing\in \omega \\). Now suppose Sal chooses an \\( n\in \omega \\). Kwan will have to show that \\( n^+\in \omega \\). Kwan can do this by showing that \\( n^+ \\) is a number, i.e, that \\( n^+ \\) is in every inductive set. Kwan asserts that this is indeed true.

To test Kwan's assertion, Sal chooses an inductive set, \\( A \\), asking Kwan to show that \\( n^+\in A \\). Kwan begins by noting that \\( n\in A \\) (because \\( n \\) is a number). Next, since \\( A \\) is inductive, we have \\( n^+\in A \\) as needed. \\( \Box \\)

It is easy to see that \\( \omega \\) is the smallest inductive set.

> Claim. If \\( A\subseteq \omega \\) is inductive, then \\( A=\omega \\).

To prove this, it suffices to show that \\( \omega\subseteq A \\), but this is obvious.

We can use the idea of inductive sets to explain the process of induction. Say we wish to show that a statement \\( P \\) holds for every number, i.e, that \\( \forall n\in \omega, \ P(n) \\), then this is equivalent to showing that \\( A=\\{n\in \omega \ \vert \ P(n)\\}=\omega \\).

If we manage to show that \\( A\subseteq \omega \\) (this is trivial) and that \\( A \\) is inductive, this would prove \\( A=\omega \\) as needed. Let us show a simple example.

> Claim. Every \\( n\in omega \\) is either \\( 0 \\) or the successor of some other number.

Proof. We shall use induction to show that

\\[ T=\\{ n\in \omega \ \vert \ n=0 \ \lor \ (\exists p\in \omega) \ p^+=n \\}=\omega. \\]

\\( 0\in T \\) is already obvious. Now suppose Sal chooses a \\( k\in T \\), then Kwan's objective is to show that \\( k^+\in T \\), i.e, he needs to show that there exists a \\( p\in \omega \\) such that \\( p^+=k^+ \\). To accomplish this, Kwan can just set \\( p=k \\). \\( \Box \\)

You are probably more familiar with having \\( n=1 \\) as the base case instead of \\( n=0 \\) like we did over here. Switching the base case changes our results slighlty, with base case \\( n=0 \\), the statement is true for \\( 0,1,2,\ldots \\). With base case \\( n=1 \\), the statement is true for \\( 1,2,3,\ldots \\). The previous sentence is true intuitively, but we must verify that this is actually the case.

> Claim. To prove that \\( P \\) is true for \\( 1,2,3,\ldots \\), it suffices to show that
\\[ T=\\{ n\in \omega \ \vert \ P(n^+) \\} \\]
is inductive.

Proof. If \\( T \\) is inductive, then \\( T=\omega \\). Now suppose Sal chooses an \\( n \\) from \\( \omega \setminus \\{0\\} \\). Kwan needs to be able to show that \\( P(n) \\).
