we wish to create/define an object \\( \lt x,y \gt \\) where \\( x,y \\) are sets (and obviously \\( <x,y> \\) will be defined in terms of sets as well) such that \\( <x,y>\neq <y,x> \\) (unless \\( x=y \\)), that is to say, this object is able to recognize/encode order. We cannot simply define \\( <x,y>=\\{x,y\\} \\) because \\( \\{x,y\\}=\\{y,x\\} \\), the order in which elements are placed in the set does not matter.

Likewise, it is important that \\( <x,y> \\) has to uniquely determine what \\( x,y \\) are, in other words, we need \\( <u,v>=<x,y> \\) if and only if \\( x=u \\) and \\( v=y \\). If this statement is true, it would also reflect the required ordering properties, that is, our previous statement implies that \\( <x,y>\neq <y,x> \\) unless \\( x=y \\).

We propose that defining 

\\[ <x,y>=\\{\\{x\\},\\{x,y\\}\\}. \\]

works, that is to say, the statement \\( <u,v>=<x,y> \\) if and only if \\( x=u \\) and \\( v=y \\) would be satisfied if we were to implement this definition.

Proof. If \\( x=u \\) and \\( v=y \\), then it is obvious that \\( <u,v>=<x,y> \\). Now suppose \\( <u,v>=<x,y> \\), the proof is presented in diagram as follows:
