we wish to create/define an object \\( <x,y> \\) where \\( x,y \\) are sets (and obviously \\( <x,y> \\) will be defined in terms of sets as well) such that \\( <x,y>\neq <y,x> \\), that is to say, this object is able to recognize/encode order. We cannot simply define \\( <x,y>=\\{x,y\\} \\) because \\( \\{x,y\\}=\\{y,x\\}=<y,x> \\), the order in which elements are placed in the set does not matter.
