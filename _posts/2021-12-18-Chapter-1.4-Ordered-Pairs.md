we wish to create/define an object \\( \lt x,y \gt \\) where \\( x,y \\) are sets (and obviously \\( <x,y> \\) will be defined in terms of sets as well) such that \\( <x,y>\neq <y,x> \\) (unless \\( x=y \\)), that is to say, this object is able to recognize/encode order. We cannot simply define \\( <x,y>=\\{x,y\\} \\) because \\( \\{x,y\\}=\\{y,x\\} \\), the order in which elements are placed in the set does not matter.

Likewise, it is important that \\( <x,y> \\) has to uniquely determine what \\( x,y \\) are, in other words, we need \\( <u,v>=<x,y> \\) if and only if \\( x=u \\) and \\( v=y \\). If this statement is true, it would also reflect the required ordering properties, that is, our previous statement implies that \\( <x,y>\neq <y,x> \\) unless \\( x=y \\).

We propose that defining 

\\[ <x,y>=\\{\\{x\\},\\{x,y\\}\\}. \\]

works, that is to say, the statement \\( <u,v>=<x,y> \\) if and only if \\( x=u \\) and \\( v=y \\) would be satisfied if we were to implement this definition.

Proof. If \\( x=u \\) and \\( v=y \\), then it is obvious that \\( <u,v>=<x,y> \\). Now suppose \\( <u,v>=<x,y> \\), we wish to show that \\( x=u \\) and that \\( v=y \\), the proof is presented in diagram as follows:

A more slick way of proving the above can be found [here](https://math.stackexchange.com/a/62937/761959).

Let \\( A \\) and \\( B \\) be two sets, we shall define \\( A\times B \\) as the cartesian product of \\( A \\) and \\( B \\), it will contain all elements of the form \\( <a,b> \\) with \\( a\in A \\) and \\( b\in B \\). For example, \\( <1,2>,<2,1>,<100,\pi> \in \mathbb{R}\times \mathbb{R} \\).

It is also sometimes the case that \\( A\times B\neq B\times A \\), for example, if \\( A=\\{a,b\\} \\) and \\( B=\\{c\\} \\), then \\( A\times B=\\{<a,c>,<b,c>\\} \\) and \\( B\times A=\\{<c,a>,<c,b>\\} \\).

It is important to show first that for any given \\( A \\) and \\( B \\), the set \\( A\times B \\) exists and can be constructed by our axioms. We employ the following theorem to do this job:

> Theorem 1.4.1 If \\( x\in C \\) and \\( y\in C \\), then \\( <x,y>\in \mathcal{P}[\mathcal{P}(C)] \\).

Proof.

From this theorem we derive the following collorary:

> Collorary 1.4.1.1 For any sets \\( A,B \\), the set \\( A\times B \\) exists.

Proof. Kwan needs to produce a set \\( S \\) which can win him the following game:

1. Sal chooses an \\( a\in A \\) and \\( b\in B \\).
2. Kwan wins if \\( <a,b>\in S \\).

Kwan proposes letting \\( S=\mathcal{P}[\mathcal{P}(A\cup B)] \\). Then,

Thus we can let

\\[ A\times B=\\{x\in S \ \vert \ \exists a\in A,\exists b\in B, \ x=<a,b>\\}. \ \\( \Box \\)\\]
