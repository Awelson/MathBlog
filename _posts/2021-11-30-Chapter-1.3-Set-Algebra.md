Just like we can add two numbers to create a new one, we can take two sets, take their union and create a new one. There is a similar underlying structure. So far we only have \\( cup \\) and \\( cap \\) as binary operations on sets, let us introduce a new one: For any two sets \\( A,B \\), define:

\\[ A-B=\\{x\in A \ \vert \ x\notin B\\}. \\]

(this exists via axiom of specification) The set \\( A-B \\) contains the elements of \\( A \\) that are not contained in \\( B \\), likewise, \\( B-A \\) represents the elements of \\( B \\) that are not in \\( A \\). Notice that \\( A-B \\) being equal to \\( B-A \\) is not necessarily true, for example, if \\( A=\\{a,b\\} \\) and \\( B=\\{b,c\\} \\), then \\( A-B=\\{a\\} \\) and \\( B-C=\\{c\\} \\). This contrasts with \\( \cup \\) and \\( \cap \\), notice that for any \\( A,B \\):

\\[ A\cup B=B\cup A, \quad A\cap B=B\cap A. \\]

Although we haven't formally proven the above, this is extremely obvious. This shows that \\( \cup \\) and \\( cap \\) are commutative operations. They are also associative: for any \\( A,B,C \\),

\\[ A\cup (B\cup C)=(A\cup B)\cup C, \quad A\cap (B\cap C)=(A\cap B)\cap C. \\]

The above is also obvious and we will not show a proof. What is less obvious is the distributive property of \\( cup \\) and \\( cap \\): for any \\( A,B,C \\),

\\[ A\cap (B\cup C)=(A\cap B)\cup (A\cap C), \quad A\cup (B\cap C)=(A\cup B)\cap (A\cup C). \\]

Let us prove the first of these identities, I will leave the second one up to you:

Proof. Here is the first game:

1. Sal picks a point \\( x\in A\cap (B\cup C) \\)
2. Kwan has two win conditions, he can either show that \\( x\in A\cap B \\) or that \\( x\in A\cap C \\)

Kwan points out that \\( x\in A \\) is true, thus the win condition is now to either show that \\( x\in B \\) or that \\( x\in C \\). Kwan points out that \\( x\in B\cup C \\) is also true, thus either \\( x\in B \\) or \\( x\in C \\) as desired.

Game 2:

1. Sal picks a point \\( x\in (A\cap B )\cup (A\cap C) \\)
2. Kwan has two win conditions: 1. show that \\( x\in A \\) 2. show either \\( x\in B \\) or \\( x\in C \\)

Kwan points out that there are two possibilities, either \\( x\in A\cap B \\) or \\( x\in A\cap C \\). Suppose that \\( x\in A\cap B \\), then \\( x\in A \\) and \\( x\in B \\), both conditions are satisfied. If instead \\( x\in A\cap C \\), then \\( x\in A \\) and \\( x\in C \\), both conditions are satisfied as well. \\( \Box \\)

> Theorem 1.3.1 [De Morgan's Laws] For any 3 sets \\( A,B,C \\):
\\[ C-(A\cup B)=(C-A)\cap (C-B), \quad C-(A\cap B)=(C-A)\cup (C-B). \\]

Proof. [First Identity] Game 1:

1. Sal picks a point \\( x\in C-(A\cup B) \\)
2. Kwan has two win conditions: 1. show that \\( x\in C-A \\) 2. show that \\( x\in C-B \\)

Kwan notices it must be that both \\( x\in C \\) and \\( x\notin A\cup B \\), but notice that

\\[ x\notin A\cup B=\neg(x\in A\cup B)=\neg(x\in A \ \lor \ x\in B)=x\notin A \ \land \ x\notin B. \\]

Combining \\( x\in C \\) with \\( x\notin A \\) gives \\( x\in C-A \\), while combining \\( x\in C \\) with \\( x\notin B \\) gives \\( x\in C-B \\). These are what is needed

Game 2: 

1. Sal picks a point \\( x\in (C-A)\cap (C-B) \\)
2. Kwan has two win conditions: 1. show that \\( x\in C \\) 2. show that \\( x\notin A\cup B \\)

Notice that the second win condition is equivalent to \\( x\notin A \ \land \ x\notin B \\) as we've figured out in the first game. Kwan points out that both \\( x\in C-A \\) and \\( x\in C-B \\) are true, \\( x\in C-A \\) implies \\( x\in C \\) and \\( x\notin A \\), \\( x\in C-B \\) implies \\( x\in C \\) and \\( x\notin B \\), these are all the win conditions satisfied.

[Second Identity] Game 1:

1. Sal picks a point \\( x\in C-(A\cap B) \\)
2. Kwan has two ways to win, he can either show that \\( x\in C-A \\) or that \\( x\in C-B \\)

Kwan notices it must be that both \\( x\in C \\) and \\( x\notin A\cap B \\), but notice that 

\\[ x\notin A\cap B=\neg(x\in A\cap B)=\neg(x\in A \ \land \ x\in B)=x\notin A \ \lor \ x\notin B. \\]

Suppose \\( x\notin A \\), then combining with \\( x\in C \\) gives \\( x\in C-A \\) as needed. Suppose \\( x\notin B \\) instead, then combining with \\( x\in C \\) gives \\( x\in C-B \\).

Game 2:

1. Sal either picks a point \\( x\in C-A \\) or a point \\( x\in C-B \\)
2. Kwan has two win conditions: 1. show that \\( x\in C \\) 2. show that \\( x\notin A\cap B \\)

The second win condition is equivalent to \\( x\notin A \ \lor \ x\notin B \\) as we've figured out in the first game. Suppose Sal chose \\( x\in C-A \\), then Kwan points out that \\( x\in C \\) and \\( x\notin A \\), the win conditions are satisfied. Suppose instead Sal chose \\( x\in C-B \\), then Kwan points out that \\( x\in C \\) and \\( x\notin b \\), the win conditions are satisfied again. \\( \Box \\)

> Theorem 1.3.2 For any two sets \\( A,C, \ A\cap (C-A)=\empty \\)

Proof. Suppose there is an element \\( x\in A\cap (C-A) \\), this means that both \\( x\in A \\) and \\( x\in C-A \\) must be true. But \\( x\in C-A \\) implies that \\( x\in C \\) and \\( x\notin A \\), this contradicts with \\( x\in A \\). Thus, \\( x\in A\cap (C-A) \\) must not contain any elements. \\( \Box \\)

It is often the case when dealing with sets that there is a canonically defined parent set to which the sets we are dealing with are a subset of. For example, when dealing with sets of numbers. i.e, \\( \\{1,3,5\\}, \ \\{100,1001\\}, \ \ldots \\), the parent set is \\( \mathbb{N} \\).

> This however is not a very good example since it may very well have easily been \\( \mathbb{R} \\) or \\( \mathbb{Z} \\) that is defined to be the parent set instead of \\( \mathbb{N} \\). Thus, the parent set is not canonically defined, however, for sake of simplicity let us just stick with \\( \mathbb{N} \\).

Identifying the parent set is useful notation-wise, for example, if \\( A \\) is a set and we know that \\( S \\) is the parent set, then we can abbreviate \\( S-A \\) as \\( -A \\), others use \\( A^c \\) (the complement of \\( A \\)). For example, if \\( A=\\{1,2,3\\} \\) and \\( S=\mathbb{N} \\), then

\\[ -A=\\{x\in \mathbb{N} \ \vert \ x\geq 4 \\}, \\]

that is, \\( -A \\) is the set of natural numbers without 1, 2, and 3.

The De Morgan Laws can thus be simplified into:

\\[ -(A\cup B)=-A\cap -B, \quad -(A\cap B)=-A\cup -B. \\]

Here are some basic facts relating a set \\( A \\) with its parent set \\( S \\):

\\[ A\cup S=S, \quad A\cap S=A, \quad A\cup -A=S, \quad A\cap -A=\varnothing. \\]

### Monotone and Antimonotone Properties

In addition to framing proofs in a game-theoretic context, I will also occasionally represent these proofs in a diagrammatic format. Here is what that would look like:

> Theorem 1.3.3 [Monotone Properties] For any three A,B,C:
\\[ \begin{align\*} 1. \ A\subseteq B \quad &\Longrightarrow \quad A\cup C\subseteq B\cup C \newline 2. \ A\subseteq B \quad &\Longrightarrow \quad A\cap C \subseteq B\cap C \newline 3. \ A\subseteq B \quad &\Longrightarrow \quad \bigcup A\subseteq \bigcup B. \end{align\*} \\]

Proof. (1) The following game needs to be won:

1. Sal chooses either an \\( x\in A \\) or an \\( x\in C \\).
2. Kwan has two options to win: either show that \\( x\in B \\) or that \\( x\in C \\). He may use the fact that \\( {A\subseteq B}^1 \\).

![Capture.PNG](/MathBlog/assets/Capture6.PNG)

> Different colored branches indicate different possibilities, when combining information on different colored branches, we need to use \\( \lor \\).

(2) The following game needs to be won:

1. Sal chooses an \\( x \\) such that both \\( x\in A \\) and \\( x\in C \\).
2. Kwan needs to show two things to win: that \\( x\in B \\) and that \\( x\in C \\). He may use the fact that \\( {A\subseteq B}^1 \\).

![Capture.PNG](/MathBlog/assets/Capture7.PNG)

> The information on same colored branches do not indicate different possibilities, i.e, both \\( x\in C \\) and \\( x\in A \\) are true. When combining information on same colored branches, we need to use \\( \land \\).

(3) is theorem 1.2.2. \\( \Box \\)

> Theorem 1.3.4 [Anti-Monotone Properties] For any three A,B,C:
\\[ \begin{align\*} 1. \ A\subseteq B \quad &\Longrightarrow \quad C-B\subseteq C-A \newline 2. \ \varnothing\neq A\subseteq B \quad &\Longrightarrow \quad \bigcap B \subseteq \bigcap A \end{align\*} \\]

Proof. (1) The following game needs to be won:

1. Sal chooses an \\( x \\) such that both \\( x\in C \\) and \\( x\notin B \\).
2. Kwan needs to show two things to win: that \\( x\in C \\) and that \\( x\notin A \\). He may use the fact that \\( {A\subseteq B} \\).

That \\( x\in C \\) is already obvious, now suppose \\( x\in A \\), then since \\( A\subseteq B \\), we have \\( x\in B \\), but this is a contradiction because Sal specifically chose so that \\( x\notin B \\). This argument can be represented diagramatically as follows:

![Capture.PNG](/MathBlog/assets/Capture9.PNG)

> The question mark represents an assumption, if it turns out that this assumption leads to a contradiction, then we can be sure that the opposite of the assumption is true. In this case, assuming that Sal chose an \\( x \\) satisfying \\( x\in A \\) gave us a contradiction, this means that Sal must have chosen an \\( x \\) that isn't from \\( A \\), which was what we needed to show.

(2) The following game needs to be won:

1. Sal chooses an \\( x\in \bigcap B \\) (thus, if Kwan were to choose any \\( b\in B \\), then it must be that \\( x \\) is in \\( b \\)).
2. Sal can pick any \\( a\in A \\), to win, Kwan needs to show that \\( x\in a \\). He may use the fact that \\( A\subseteq B \\).

Whatever \\( a \\) Sal chooses is an element of \\( B \\) since \\( a\in A\subseteq B \\). Thus, Kwan can choose the element \\( a\in B \\), and it would be true that \\( x\in a \\). Diagramatically, this can be represented as follows:

![Capture.PNG](/MathBlog/assets/Capture8.PNG)

> The numbers next to an action (Kwan chooses, etc..) represent the order in which a player's action is taken. The order is decided by how the game is defined and it is an important matter. In this example, Sal chooses both an \\( x \\) and an \\( a \\) before Kwan's move, obviously if it is Kwan's move first then he cannot choose whatever \\( a\in A \\) that Sal chose, and therefore the winning strategy no longer works.

\\( \Box \\)

### Distributive Laws

> Theorem 1.3.5 For any two sets, \\( A, \mathcal{B} \\):
\\[ A \cup \bigcap \mathcal{B}=\bigcap \\{A\cup X \ \vert \ X\in \mathcal{B}\\}, \quad A \cap \bigcup \mathcal{B}=\bigcap \\{A\cap X \ \vert \ X\in \mathcal{B}\\}. \\]

What we mean by \\( S=\\{A\cup X \ \vert \ X\in \mathcal{B}\\} \\) is the set which contains all elements of the form \\( A\cup X \\) for some \\( X\in \mathcal{B} \\). For example, if \\( \mathcal{B}=\\{a,b,c\\} \\), then \\( S=\\{A\cup a,A\cup b,A\cup c\\} \\), thus

\\[ t\in S \quad \Longleftrightarrow \quad \exists X\in \mathcal{B}, \ t=A\cup X. \\]

and similarly for \\( \\{A\cap X \ \vert \ X\in \mathcal{B}\\} \\). Before proving the theorem, let us first show that this set exists, we will do so with the axiom of specification.

> Claim. \\( S \\) exists.

Proof. This: \\( \\{t \ \vert \ \exists X\in \mathcal{B}, \ t=A\cup X\\} \\), does not suffice because we need to specify a set with which we can filter our \\( t \\)'s from. We need to find a set \\( S' \\) for which \\( A\cup X\in S' \\) for all \\( X\in \mathcal{B} \\). We propose that \\( S'=\mathcal{P}(A\cup \bigcup \mathcal{B}) \\) suits our purposes. How shall we prove this? Consider the following game:

1. Sal may choose any \\( X\in \mathcal{B} \\).
2. Kwan has to show that \\( A\cup X\in S' \\).

Proof. Showing that \\( A\cup X\in S' \\) is equivalent to showing that \\( A\cup X\subseteq A\cup \bigcup\mathcal{B} \\), to accomplish this, Kwan will ask Sal to play the following game:

1. Sal may either choose an \\( x\in A \\) or an \\( x\in X \\).
2. To win, Kwan has to show that either \\( x\in A \\) or that \\( x\in \bigcup \mathcal{B} \\).

If Kwan has a winning startegy for this game, he can translate that into a winning strategy for the original game, this is how it would look:
