Just like we can add two numbers to create a new one, we can take two sets, take their union and create a new one. There is a similar underlying structure. So far we only have \\( cup \\) and \\( cap \\) as binary operations on sets, let us introduce a new one: For any two sets \\( A,B \\), define:

\\[ A-B=\\{x\in A \ \vert \ x\notin B\\}. \\]

(this exists via axiom of specification) The set \\( A-B \\) contains the elements of \\( A \\) that are not contained in \\( B \\), likewise, \\( B-A \\) represents the elements of \\( B \\) that are not in \\( A \\). Notice that \\( A-B \\) being equal to \\( B-A \\) is not necessarily true, for example, if \\( A=\\{a,b\\} \\) and \\( B=\\{b,c\\} \\), then \\( A-B=\\{a\\} \\) and \\( B-C=\\{c\\} \\). This contrasts with \\( cup \\) and \\( cap \\), notice that for any \\( A,B \\):

\\[ A\cup B=B\cup A, \quad A\cap B=B\cap A. \\]

Although we haven't formally proven the above, this is extremely obvious. This shows that \\( \cup \\) and \\( cap \\) are commutative operations. They are also associative: for any \\( A,B,C \\):

\\[ A\cup (B\cup C)=(A\cup B)\cup C, \quad A\cap (B\cap C)=(A\cap B)\cap C. \\]
