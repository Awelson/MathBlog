Just like we can add two numbers to create a new one, we can take two sets, take their union and create a new one. There is a similar underlying structure. So far we only have \\( cup \\) and \\( cap \\) as binary operations on sets, let us introduce a new one: For any two sets \\( A,B \\), define:

\\[ A-B=\\{x\in A \ \vert \ x\notin B\\}. \\]

(this exists via axiom of specification)
