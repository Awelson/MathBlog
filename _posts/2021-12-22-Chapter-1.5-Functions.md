> Definition. A function is a relation \\( R \\) such that for every \\( x\in \text{dom }R \\), there is only one \\( y\in \text{im }R \\) such that \\( xRy \\). Additionally, a function may be paired/assigned a codomain, this can be any set \\( B \\) such that \\( \text{im }R\subseteq B \\).

We can create a function as follows, first: choose a set \\( A \\), then second: provide instructions to assign/transform every element of \\( A \\) into some other. The function will then consist of ordered pairs with elements of \\( A \\) in the first coordinate, and the result of the transformation in the second coordinate. For example if \\( A=\\{1,2,3\\} \\) and the transformation is that of squaring the number, then the resulting function, \\( f \\) is

\\[ f=\\{ <1,1>,<2,4>,<3,9> \\}. \\]

Here are some points to consider:

- The set, \\( A \\), that we chose in the first step will become the domain of \\( f \\). Really then, the first step of creating a function is to choose what its domain will be.
- Some transformations instructions may not result in a function, for example, if \\( A=\\{1\\} \\) and the instruction is to assign 1 to the number 2 and also to the number 3, then the resulting function is given by \\( \\{<1,2>,<1,3>\\} \\), but this relation does not satisfy the required conditions to be a function.


> Notation. If \\( f \\) is a function and \\( x\in \text{dom }f \\), then we shall let \\( f(x) \\) denote whatever is the result of transforming \\( x \\) with the function \\( f \\). Note that if \\( f \\) is not a function, but instead a relation, then this notation makes no sense. For example, if
\\[ f=\\{ <1,2>,<1,3> \\} \\]
then \\( f(1) \\) can either be 2 or 3, the notation becomes ambiguous.

> Notation. The above notation is useful for communicating instructions without being too descriptive, for example instead of saying "let the transformation be that of squaring the number" we can write "let \\( f(x)=x^2 \\)".

- Transformation instructions need not necessarily send one type of objects to the same type, for example, the function that is assigned the domain \\( \mathbb{R} \\) and the instruction \\( f(x)=<x,x+1> \\) transforms a real number into an object of type \\( \mathbb{R} \times \mathbb{R} \\), that is, into an ordered pair of real numbers.

> Notation. Let \\( f \\) be a function, we write \\( f:A\to B \\) to indicate that the domain of \\( f \\) is \\( A \\), and that we have assigned \\( B \\) as its codomain.
