I'm sure we are all familiar with what functions are, it basically contains the instructions/information required in order to assign an element of a set (the domain) to a unique element of a possibly different set (the codomain). For example, the function \\( f:\mathbb{R}\to \mathbb{R} \\) has \\( \mathbb{R} \\) as both the domain and codomain, this means that it assigns a real number, \\( x \\) to another real number, which we denote \\( f(x) \\). However, we cannot yet compute \\( f(x) \\), for example, we don't know what \\( f(2) \\) is, we have only introduced the domain and codomain of the function, but not yet the assignment instructions. 

Let us make up an instruction for our function \\( f \\) to follow, we shall instruct it to assign a real number \\( x \\) to its square, \\( x^2 \\). This instruction can be written as follows: \\( f(x)=x^2 \\). Thus, we can now compute \\( f(2)=2^2=4 \\), so we know that \\( f \\) assigns the number 2 to the number 4.
