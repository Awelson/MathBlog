> Definition. A function is a relation \\( R \\) such that for every \\( x\in \text{dom }R \\), there is only one \\( y\in \text{im }R \\) such that \\( xRy \\). Additionally, a function may be paired/assigned a codomain, this can be any set \\( B \\) such that \\( \text{im }R\subseteq B \\).

We can create a function as follows, choose a set \\( A \\), then provide instructions to assign/transform every element of \\( A \\) into some other. The function will then consist of ordered pairs with elements of \\( A \\) in the first coordinate, and the result of the transformation in the second coordinate. For example if \\( A=\\{1,2,3\\} \\) and the transformation is that of squaring the number, then the resulting function, \\( f \\) is

\\[ f=\\{ <1,1>,<2,4>,<3,9> \\}. \\]

Here are some points to consider:

- The set, \\( A \\), that we chose in the first step will be the domain of \\( f \\).
- If \\( f \\) is a function and \\( xfy \\) (or alternatively \\( <x,y>\in f \\)), then we may write \\( y=f(x) \\), and it means: \\( y \\) is the result of transforming \\( x \\) with the function \\( f \\).
- We may use the above notation to as a way to communicate the transformation instructions without being descriptive, for example, we write \\( f(x)=x^2 \\) to indicate that the transformation is that of squaring the number.
- Some transformations instructions may not result in a function, for example, if \\( A=\\{1\\} \\) and the instruction is to assign 1 to the number 2 and also to the number 3, then the resulting function is given by \\( \\{<1,2>,<1,3>\\} \\), but this relation does not satisfy the required conditions to be a function.
- Transformations are not necessarily converting one type of object into the same type again, for example, consider \\( f(x)=\begin{bmatrix} x \newline x+1 \end{bmatrix} \\), this transformation sends a number to a 2 dimensional vector.
