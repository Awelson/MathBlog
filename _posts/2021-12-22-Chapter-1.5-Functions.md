I'm sure we are all familiar with what functions are, it basically contains the instructions/information required in order to assign every element of a set (the domain) to a unique element of a possibly different set (the codomain). For example, the function \\( f:\mathbb{R}\to \mathbb{R} \\) has \\( \mathbb{R} \\) as both the domain and codomain, this means that it assigns every real number, \\( x \\) to another real number, which we denote \\( f(x) \\). However, we cannot yet compute \\( f(x) \\), for example, we don't know what \\( f(2) \\) is, we have only introduced the domain and codomain of the function, but not yet the assignment instructions. 

Let us make up an instruction for our function \\( f \\) to follow, we shall instruct it to assign a real number \\( x \\) to its square, \\( x^2 \\). This instruction can be written as follows: \\( f(x)=x^2 \\). Thus, we can now compute \\( f(2)=2^2=4 \\), so we know that \\( f \\) assigns the number 2 to the number 4. Each individual assignment that \\( f \\) makes can be represented as a list of ordered pairs:

\\[ <2,4>, \quad <1,1>, \quad <1/2,1/4>, \quad \cdots \\]

The first coordinate denotes whatever is being assigned and the second coordinate denotes the result of the assignment. We shall define our function as the relation that is obtained by placing all of these ordered pairs into a set. It is important at this point to stress that a function must not assign an element of its domain to more than element in the codomain, this means that for every \\( x\in \text{dom }f \\), there must only be one \\( y\in \text{codom }f \\) such that \\( <x,y>\in f \\) or \\( xfy \\) or \\( f(x)=y \\) (these are just three different ways of showing the same thing). All in all, a function is just a relation that satisfies the condition we just set earlier, conversely, any relation satisfying the condition can also be considered as a function.

If we write \\( f:A\to B \\), then we must have \\( \text{dom }f=A \\) and \\( \text{im }f\subseteq B \\). Having \\( \text{im }f\subseteq B \\) means that not every \\( y\in B \\) needs to have an \\( x\in A \\) for which \\( f(x)=y \\). For example, consider \\( f:\mathbb{R}\to\mathbb{R}, \ f(x)=x^2 \\), the number -1 is in the codomain, but there is no real number that is assigned to -1 by the function \\( f \\). In this example, \\( \text{im }f=\mathbb{R}^+ \\) (proof later), every real number is assigned to one that is greater than zero, that is to say, \\( f(x)\geq 0 \\) for all \\( x\in \mathbb{R} \\). If it helps, we can think of \\( \text{im }f \\) as the set \\( \\{ y\in \bigcup\bigcup f \ \vert \ \exists x\in A, \ y=f(x) \\} \\) or more simply (but less formally) as \\( \\{ f(x) \ \vert \ x\in A \\} \\).

### Onto Functions

Let \\( f \\) be a function, then we say that \\( f \\) maps onto the set \\( B \\) if \\( \text{im }f=B \\). For example, we say that the function \\( f(x)=x^2 \\) with domain \\( \mathbb{R} \\) maps onto the set \\( \mathbb{R}^+ \\) because \\( \text{im }f=\mathbb{R}^+ \\). To prove this:

Proof. Pick a \\( y\in \text{im }f \\), this means that there exists an \\( x\in \mathbb{R} \\) for which \\( f(x)=x^2=y \\). Instead of proving \\( y\in \mathbb{R}^+ \\), we can prove \\( x^2\in \mathbb{R}^+ \\) instead, which is easy, because we know that the square of a real number is always greater than zero.

Now pick a \\( y\in \mathbb{R}^+ \\), to show that \\( y\in \text{im }f \\), we need to show that there exists an \\( x\in \mathbb{R} \\) such that \\( f(x)=x^2=y \\). We can present either the number \\( +\sqrt{y} \\) or \\( -\sqrt{y} \\), both works fine for our purposes. \\( \Box \\) 

### One-to-one Functions

Notice that it is possible for a function to assign more than one element in its domain to a single element in its codomain, i.e, it is possible to have \\( f(x_1)=f(x_2) \\) eventhough \\( x_1\neq x_2 \\). If this were not the case, i.e, \\( f(x_1)=f(x_2) \\) iff \\( x_1=x_2 \\), then the function is said to be one-to-one. Another way of saying this is that a function is one=to-one if for each \\( y\in \text{im }f \\), there is only one \\( x\in \text{dom }f \\) such that \\( xfy \\).

For example, the function \\( f(x)=x^2 \\) with domain \\( \mathbb{R} \\) is not one-to-one because \\( f(-2)=f(2) \\) but \\( -2\neq 2 \\). However, if the domain were \\( \mathbb{R}^+ \\) instead, then there would be no problem, \\( f(-2) \\) does not exist, it is not defined, and we cannot use it in our argument, thus 2 now becomes the only element in our domain that assigns to 4. Of course, we would have to show that this is true for any \\( y\in \text{im }f \\) we decide to choose, not only 4.

### Addition as a Function

Addition can be thought of as the function \\( f:\mathbb{R}\times \mathbb{R}\to \mathbb{R} \\), it assigns an ordered pair of real numbers \\( <a,b> \\), to the real number \\( a+b \\), so for example, \\( f \\) maps \\( <4,5>\to 9 \\), and so on. \\( f \\) itself would look something like:

\\[ f=\\{<<4,5>,9>,<<1,0>,1>,<<-2,2>,0>,\cdots\\}. \\]

### Inverses

The inverse of a function \\( f \\) is denoted \\( f^{-1} \\) and defined as

\\[ f^{-1}=\\{<y,x> \ \vert \ xFy\\}. \\]

So for example, if

\\[ f=\\{<x_1,y_1>,<x_2,y_2>\\}, \quad f^{-1}=\\{<y_1,x_1>,<y_2,x_2>\\}. \\]

It is important to note that the inverse of a function may not be a function itself, for example, if

\\[ f=\\{<x_1,y>,<x_2,y>\\}, \quad f^{-1}=\\{<y,x_1>,<y,x_2>\\}. \\]

Assuming \\( x_1\neq x_2 \\), then \\( f^{-1} \\) is not a function because it maps \\( y \\) to two different elements.
