> Definition. A function is a relation \\( R \\) such that for every \\( x\in \text{dom }R \\), there is only one \\( y\in \text{Im }R \\) such that \\( xRy \\). Additionally, a function may be paired/assigned a codomain, this can be any set \\( B \\) such that \\( \text{Im }R\subseteq B \\).

We can create a function as follows, first: choose a set \\( A \\), then second: provide instructions to assign/transform every element of \\( A \\) into some other. The function will then consist of ordered pairs with elements of \\( A \\) in the first coordinate, and the result of the transformation in the second coordinate. For example if \\( A=\\{1,2,3\\} \\) and the transformation is that of squaring the number, then the resulting function, \\( f \\) is

\\[ f=\\{ <1,1>,<2,4>,<3,9> \\}. \\]

Here are some points to consider:

- The set, \\( A \\), that we chose in the first step will become the domain of \\( f \\). Really then, the first step of creating a function is to choose what its domain will be.
- Some transformations instructions may not result in a function, for example, if \\( A=\\{1\\} \\) and the instruction is to assign 1 to the number 2 and also to the number 3, then the resulting function is given by \\( \\{<1,2>,<1,3>\\} \\), but this relation does not satisfy the required conditions to be a function. We don't have to be wary of making such transformations, they are very easy to spot and notice.


> Notation. If \\( F \\) is a function and \\( x\in \text{dom }F \\), then we shall let \\( F(x) \\) denote whatever is the result of transforming \\( x \\) with the function \\( F \\). Note that if \\( F \\) is not a function, but instead a relation, then this notation makes no sense. For example, if
\\[ F=\\{ <1,2>,<1,3> \\} \\]
then \\( F(1) \\) can either be 2 or 3, the notation becomes ambiguous. There is no problem if\\( F \\) is a function, by definition, there is only one possible value that \\( F(x) \\) can be, that is, \\( F(x) \\) is the unique \\( y\in \text{Im }F \\) for which \\( xFy \\).

> Notation. The above notation is useful for communicating instructions without being too descriptive, for example instead of saying "let the transformation be that of squaring the number" we can write "let \\( f(x)=x^2 \\)".

- Transformation instructions need not necessarily send one type of objects to the same type, for example, the function that is assigned the domain \\( \mathbb{R} \\) and the instruction \\( f(x)=<x,x+1> \\) transforms a real number into an object of type \\( \mathbb{R} \times \mathbb{R} \\), that is, into an ordered pair of real numbers.

> Notation. Let \\( f \\) be a function, we write \\( f:A\to B \\) to indicate that the domain of \\( f \\) is \\( A \\), and that we have assigned \\( B \\) as its codomain.

### Surjective/Onto Functions

> Definition. Let \\( f:A\to B \\) be a function, we say that it is surjective/onto if \\( \text{im }f=B \\). Note that the property of surjectivity is only given to functions which has been assigned a codomain, otherwise, it is not possible to determine whether or not a function is surjective.

Given a function \\( f \\), assigning it the codomain \\( \text{im }f \\) automatically makes it surjective. The problem often lies with explicitly calculating what the image of \\( f \\) is. For example, let \\( f(x)=x^2 \\) with the domain \\( [-1,2] \\), you can draw a graph and find that the image is \\( [0,4] \\), but let us formally prove this.

Proof. Choose some \\( y\in \text{im }f \\), then there exists some \\( x\in [-1,2] \\) such that \\( x^2=y \\). Now we prove \\( x^2\in [0,4] \\) (instead of \\( y\in [0,4] \\)). It is clear that \\( x^2\geq 0 \\), so it suffices to prove that \\( x^2\leq 4 \\). Suppose \\( x^2>4 \\), then \\( x>2 \\), but this is impossible since \\( x\in [-1,2] \\).

Choose some \\( y\in [0,4] \\), now we need to find some \\( x\in [-1,2] \\) for which \\( x^2=y \\). Letting \\( x=+\sqrt{y} \\) works, furthermore, since \\( 0\leq y\leq 4 \\), we have \\( 0\leq +\sqrt{y}\leq 2 \\). \\( \Box \\)

Thus, we may conclude that \\( f:[-1,2]\to [0,4] \\) with \\( f(x)=x^2 \\) is surjective.

### Injective/One-to-one Functions

> Definition. Let \\( R \\) be a relation, then we say that it is single-rooted if for each \\( y\in \text{im }R \\) there is only one \\( x \\) such that \\( xRy \\) (or \\( R(x)=y \\) if \\( R \\) is a function). If a function is single-rooted, we say it is injective/one-to-one, notice that it is not neccessary to assign a codomain to determine whether or not a function is injective, this contrasts with surjectivity.

Example: The function \\( f(x)=x^2 \\) with domain \\( \mathbb{R} \\) is not injective because \\( 4\in \text{im }f \\) but \\( f(-2)=f(2)=4 \\), there are 2 elements in the domain of \\( f \\) which maps to 4. It turns out that if we change the domain of \\( f \\) into \\( [0,\infty) \\) instead then the function does become injective.

> Alternate Definition. A function is injective iff for any \\( x_1,x_2\in \text{dom }f \\) such that \\( f(x_1)=f(x_2) \\) we must have \\( x_1=x_2 \\). It is easy to justify this alternate definition, it is also much more convenient to use.

### Some more Definitions:

> Definition. 
- Let \\( F \\) be a relation, its inverse, \\( F^{-1} \\) is given by
\\[ F^{-1}=\\{<y,x> \ \vert \ <x,y>\in F\\} \\]
- Let \\( F,G \\) be relations, its composition, \\( F\circ G \\) is given by
\\[ \\{<x,z> \ \vert \ \exists y, \ (xGy \ \land \ yFz)\\} \\]
- Let \\( F \\) be a relation, its restriction on the set \\( A \\), \\( F\|_A \\) is given by
\\[ \\{<x,y> \ \vert \ x\in A \ \land \ xFy\\} \\]
- Let \\( F \\) be a relation, the image of a set \\( A \\) under \\( F \\) is given by
\\[ F[A]=\\{ y \ \vert \ \exists x\in A, \ xFy \\} \\]
It is typically assumed that \\( A\subseteq \text{dom }F \\) whenever we define the image of \\( F \\), although the definition accepts larger sets than \\( \text{dom }F \\) we will pretend to ignore this possibility.

The definitions above are not very rigorous, we don't know if the definitions define "valid" sets. Fortunately, it is, however, easy to check that these definitions do give rise to valid sets. For example, given a relation \\( F \\), all elements that are supposed to be in \\( F^{-1} \\) can be found in \\( \text{im }F\times \text{dom }F \\). Thus,

\\[ F^{-1}=\\{t\in \text{im }F\times \text{dom }F \ \vert \ \exists x,y \ (<y,x>=t \ \land \ xFy)\\} \\]

which exists by the axiom of specification. We can do something similar for the others. For instance, \\( G\circ F\subseteq \text{dom }F\times \text{im }G \\), \\( F\|_A\subseteq F \\) and \\( F[A]\subseteq \text{im }F \\), and now all that is needed is to figure out how exactly to filter the bigger sets to obtain the smaller ones. I'll leave that up to you.

**An Example.** Let 

\\[ F=\\{<\varnothing,a>,<\\{\varnothing\\},b>\\}, \\]

then \\( F \\) is a function, however,

\\[ F^{-1}=\\{<a,\varnothing>,<b,\\{\varnothing\\}>\\} \\]

is a function only if \\( a\neq b \\). The restriction, \\( F\|_\varnothing \\) is empty because

\\[ F\|_\varnothing=\\{<x,y> \ \vert \ x\in \varnothing \ \land \ xFy\\} \\]

but clearly there is no \\( x \\) satisfying \\( x\in \varnothing \\). However, notice that

\\[ F\|_{\\{\varnothing\\}}=\\{<\varnothing,a>\\}. \\]

We also have \\( F[\\{\varnothing\\}]=\\{a\\} \\) which is in contrast to \\( F(\\{\varnothing\\})=b \\).

From the previous example it is clear that if \\( F \\) is a function, then \\( F^{-1} \\) is not necessarily a function as well. We can, however, guarantee that it is a relation, so we can always talk about the image of \\( F^{-1} \\), dubbed the inverse image, eventhough \\( F \\) is not a function (Theorem 1.5.2). The idea of inverse images will be important later on.

> Lemma 1.5.1 Let \\( F \\) be a relation, then \\( \text{dom }F=\text{im }F^{-1} \\).

Proof. Game 1: Sal chooses an \\( x\in \text{dom }F \\), Kwan can win by showing that \\( x\in \text{im }F^{-1} \\), this amounts to being able to find a \\( y \\) such that \\( yF^{-1}x \\).

Game 2: Sal chooses an \\( x\in \text{im }F^{-1} \\), Kwan can win by showing that \\( x\in \text{dom }F \\), this amounts to being able to find a \\( y \\) such that \\( xFy \\).

> Asserting that \\( \exists x, \ P(x) \\) is equivalent to Kwan being able to find an \\( x \\) for which \\( P(x) \\) holds true. 

\\( \Box \\)

> \\( \text{im }F=\text{dom }F^{-1} \\) is also true and can be proven in a similar way.

> Theorem 1.5.2 If \\( F \\) is a relation, then \\( F^{-1}[A]=\\{x\in \text{dom }F \ \vert \ \exists y\in A, \ xFy\\} \\).

Proof. By definition, \\( F^{-1}[A]=\\{ x\in \text{im }F^{-1} \ \vert \ \exists y\in A, \ yF^{-1}x\\} \\) but \\( yF^{-1}x \\) is equivalent to \\( xFy \\) and \\( \text{im }F^{-1}=\text{dom }F \\) by the previous lemma, therefore

\\[ F^{-1}[A]=\\{ x\in \text{dom }F \ \vert \ \exists y\in A, \ xFy \\} \\]

or if \\( F \\) is a function, then

\\[ F^{-1}[A]=\\{ x\in \text{dom }F \ \vert \ F(x)\in A \\} \\]

Example: If \\( F=\\{<1,2>,<2,2>\\} \\), then

\\[ F^{-1}[\\{2\\}]=\\{1,2\\}. \\]

> Theorem 1.5.3 \\( F \\) is a single-rooted relation iff \\( F^{-1} \\) is a function. Similarly, \\( F \\) is a function iff \\( F^{-1} \\) is a single-rooted relation. Taken together, \\( F \\) is a one-to-one function iff \\( F^{-1} \\) is a one-to-one function.

Proof.

![Capture.PNG](/MathBlog/assets/Capture17.PNG)

The second statement follows similarly. \\( \Box \\)

Notice that if \\( F \\) is a relation, then \\( (F^{-1})^{-1}=F \\). This observation will be helpful in proving the next theorem.

> Theorem 1.5.4 Suppose \\( F \\) is a one-to-one function. If \\( x\in \text{dom }F \\) then \\( F^{-1}(F(x))=x \\) and if \\( y\in \text{ran }F \\) then \\( F(F^{-1}(y))=y \\).

Proof. First notice that since \\( F \\) is a one-to-one function, then by theorem 1.5.3, \\( F^{-1} \\) is also a one-to-one function, so the notation makes sense. If \\( x\in \text{dom }F \\), then \\( <x,F(x)>\in F \\) and so \\( <F(x),x>\in F^{-1} \\), thus, \\( F^{-1}(F(x))=x \\).

Now suppose \\( y\in \text{ran }F \\), then \\( y\in \text{dom }F^{-1} \\), since \\( F^{-1} \\) is one-to-one, we can apply the first part of theorem 1.5.4, this gives \\( (F^{-1})^{-1}(F^{-1}(y))=y \\) but since \\( (F^{-1})^{-1}=F \\) we are done. \\( \Box \\)

> Theorem 1.5.5 Suppose \\( F \\) and \\( G \\) are functions, then \\( F\circ G \\) is a function as well whose domain is

\\[ \\{ x\in \text{dom }G \ \vert \ G(x)\in \text{dom }F \\}, \\]

and for \\( x \\) in its domain, \\( F\circ G=F(G(x)) \\).

Proof. First we will show that \\( F\circ G \\) is a function. Suppose Sal disagrees, claiming that he has found an \\( x\in \text{dom }F\circ G \\) for which \\( x(F\circ G)z \\) and \\( x(F\circ G)z' \\) but \\( z\neq z' \\). Kwan's win condition is to prove that Sal is lying. 

First, he will observe that there must exist, by definition, \\( t,t' \\) such that

\\[ xGt \ \land \ tFz, \quad xGt' \ \land \ t'Fz'. \\]

Since \\( G \\) is a function, we must have \\( t=t' \\), and since \\( F \\) is a function, we have \\( z=z' \\). Kwan wins.

To prove the domain claim, Sal chooses an \\( x \\) such that both \\( x\in \text{dom }G \\) and \\( G(x)\in \text{dom }F \\), to win, Kwan needs to show that \\( x\in \text{dom }F\circ G \\). To do this, he needs to show that there exists a \\( y \\) such that \\( <x,y>\in F\circ G \\). Kwan calls upon \\( F(G(x)) \\), to show that \\( <x,F(G(x))>\in F\circ G \\) is true, Kwan points out that

\\[ <x,G(x)>\in G, \quad <G(x),F(G(x))>\in F \\]

so by definition, \\( <x,F(G(x))\in F\circ G \\). This also proves that \\( (F\circ G)(x)=F(G(x)) \\) for \\( x \\) in its domain. We also need to prove the reverse, that if \\( x\in \text{dom }F\circ G \\), then both \\( x\in \text{dom }G \\) and \\( G(x)\in \text{dom }F \\). By definition there has to exist some \\( y \\) and \\( z \\) for which \\( xGy \ \land \ yFz \\). The first half means that \\( x\in \text{dom }G \\) and upon noticing that \\( G(x)=y \\), the second half gives \\( G(x)\in \text{dom }F \\). \\( \Box \\)

> Theorem 1.5.6 For any two relations \\( F,G \\) we have
\\[ (F\circ G)^{-1}=G^{-1}\circ F^{-1} \\]

Proof. Having \\( <x,y>\in (F\circ G)^{-1} \\) is equivalent to

\\[ \begin{align\*} <y,x>\in F\circ G, \ &\Longleftrightarrow \ \exists t, \ yGt \ \land tFx, \newline &\Longleftrightarrow \ \exists t, \  xF^{-1}t \ \land \ tG^{-1}y, \newline &\Longrightarrow \ <x,y>\in G^{-1}\circ F^{-1}. \quad \Box \end{align\*} \\]

> Definition. For any set \\( A \\) we define the identity function on \\( A \\), as the function \\( I_A \\) with domain \\( A \\) and \\( I_A(x)=x \\) for every \\( x\in A \\).

The proof for the next theorem requires a new axiom, however we will introduce the proof first and only until we get stuck will we introduce this new axiom. This will highlight the purposes/motivation for coming up with such an axiom.

> Theorem 1.5.7 Let \\( F:A\to B \\) be a function and let \\( A \\) be nonempty. Then,
- There exists a function \\( G:B\to A \\) (a "left inverse") such that \\( G\circ F \\) is the identity function \\( I_A \\) on \\( A \\) iff \\( F \\) is one-to-one.
- There exists a function \\( H \\) with domain \\( B \\) (a "right inverse") such that \\( F\circ H \\) is the identity function \\(I_B \\) on \\( B \\) iff \\( F \\) is surjective.

Proof. 1) First assume that there is a function \\( G \\) for which \\( G\circ F=I_A \\). It is not possible for there to exist distinct \\( x,y\in \text{dom }F \\) where \\( F(x)=F(y) \\) because then,

\\[ x=G(F(x))=G(F(y))=y, \\]

so \\( F \\) is one-to-one. For the converse, assume \\( F \\) is one-to-one. Kwan needs to construct a function \\( G \\) with domain \\( B \\), this means that he has to provide instructions that dictates the transformation of the elements of \\( B \\). Afterwards, Kwan can assign \\( A \\) as the codomain of \\( G \\), but before this can be done we must have \\( \text{Im }G\subseteq A \\), we must also satisfy \\( G(F(x))=x \\) for all \\( x\in A \\) (it is easy to check that \\( \text{dom }G\circ F=A \\))

First, Kwan notices that \\( F^{-1} \\) is a function as well (Theorem 1.5.3), it has domain \\( \text{Im }F \\). His idea is to make \\( G \\) follow exactly what \\( F^{-1} \\) is doing, that is, Kwan shall let \\( G(x)=F^{-1}(x) \\) for all \\( x\in \text{Im }F \\). Since \\( \text{Im }F\subseteq B \\), there might still be some elements in \\( B \\) that are left unaccounted for, in particular, elements from \\( B-\text{Im }F \\) (if it isn't empty) are left without instructions.

To remedy this, Kwan chooses an element \\( a\in A \\) (which he can do because \\( A \\) is nonempty) and he lets \\( G(x)=a \\) for all \\( x\in B-\text{Im }F \\). All in all, 

\\[ G(x) = \begin{cases}
   F^{-1}(x) &\text{if } x\in \text{Im }F \newline
   a &\text{if } x\in B-\text{Im }F.
\end{cases} \\]

Since \\( B=\text{Im }F \cup (B-\text{Im }F) \\) all elements of \\( B \\) are accounted for and \\( G \\) can be considered as a function with domain \\( B \\). We should now check that \\( \text{Im }G\subseteq A \\) and that \\( G(F(x))=x \\) for all \\( x\in A \\). For the first condition, we need to check that \\( G(x)\in A \\) for all \\( x\in B \\), I'll have you fill in the details.

For the second one, notice that \\( F(x)\in \text{Im }F \\) for all \\( x\in A \\), thus

\\[ G(F(x))=F^{-1}(F(x))=x, \quad \text{for all }x\in A. \\]

2) Assume that there is a function \\( H:B\to A \\) for which \\( F\circ H=I_B \\). We need to show that \\( \text{Im }F=B \\), it suffices to show that \\( B\subseteq \text{Im }F \\) because the converse is already a given. Sal picks an element \\( y\in B \\), Kwan points out that \\( F(H(y))=y \\) by assumption which means \\( <H(y),y>\in F \\) which means \\( y\in \text{Im }F \\) as needed.

For the converse, assume that \\( F:A\to B \\) is surjective, i.e, \\( \text{Im }F=B \\). Kwan needs to construct a function \\( H \\) with domain \\( B \\) so that \\( F(H(y))=x \\) for all \\( y\in B \\) and that \\( \text{Im }H\subseteq A \\) so that he can assign \\( A \\) for the codomain. 

Here is Kwan's idea, since \\( \text{Im }F=B \\), for any \\( y\in B=\text{Im }F \\), he will exploit the fact that there must exist (at least one) \\( x\in \text{dom }F=A \\) for which \\( F(x)=y \\). In cases where there is more than one candidate for \\( x \\), Kwan will simply choose one of them randomly, "This is what \\( y\in B \\) will transform into, the function \\( H \\) shall follow these rules", Kwan said. Firstly, it is clear that \\( \text{Im }H\subseteq A \\), further, for any \\( y\in B \\), \\( \ H(y) \\) is one of the \\( x \\)'s that satisfy \\( F(x)=y \\), so \\( F(H(y))=y \\) as we expect. However, there is a flaw in Kwan's construction, the part where he randomly chooses one of the \\( x \\)'s is not permissible, the axioms we currently have allow no such things. To fix this, we can simply introduce one:

> Axiom of Choice (first form) For any relation \\( R \\), there is a function \\( H\subseteq R \\) with \\( \text{dom }H=\text{dom }R \\), and \\( \text{Im }H\subseteq \text{Im }R \\).

Let us digest what the above says, say for example we have a relation

\\[ R=\\{<1,4>,<1,2>,<2,7>\\}. \\]

Notice that this relation fails to be a function, the axiom of choice however, states that we can extract a function out of this relation, for example, we could have

\\[ H=\\{<1,4>,<2,7>\\}, \quad \text{or} \quad H=\\{<1,2>,<2,7>\\}. \\]

How \\( H \\) is "extracted" from \\( R \\) is by removing ordered pairs which contribute towards the mapping of an element to more than one point. In this case, \\( R \\) contains both \\( <1,4> \\) and \\( <1,2> \\) so getting rid of one of them will turn \\( R \\) into a function, in doing so, we are "choosing" which one of them survives.  

How does this help us? Notice that \\( F^{-1} \\) is not a function this time unlike (1), it is however a relation which we can extract a function out of. Let \\( H \\) be the function created from extraction of \\( F^{-1} \\), then \\( \text{dom }H=\text{dom }F^{-1}=\text{Im }F=B \\). Further, for any \\( y\in B \\), \\( <y,H(y)>\in F^{-1} \\), hence \\( <H(y),y>\in F \\) so \\( F(H(y))=y \\) as needed, and since \\( \text{Im }H\subseteq \text{Im }F^{-1}=A \\), we can set \\( A \\) as the codomain of \\( H \\). \\( \Box \\)

> Theorem 1.5.8 Let \\( F \\) be a relation with \\( A,B \subseteq \text{dom }F \\), then 
- \\( F[A\cup B]=F[A]\cup F[B] \\)
- \\( F[A\cap B]\subseteq F[A]\cap F[B] \\)

Proof. 1)
\\[ \begin{align\*} y\in F[A\cup B] \quad &\Longleftrightarrow \quad \exists x\in A\cup B, \ xFy \newline &\Longleftrightarrow \quad \exists x_1\in A, \ xFy \ \lor \ \exists x_2\in B, xFy \newline &\Longleftrightarrow \quad y\in F[A] \lor \ y\in F[B]. \end{align\*} \\]

2)
\\[ \begin{align\*} y\in F[A\cap B] \quad &\Longrightarrow \quad \exists x\in A\cap B, \ xFy \newline &\Longrightarrow \quad \exists x_1\in A, \ xFy \ \land \ \exists x_2\in B, \ xFy \newline &\Longrightarrow \quad y\in F[A] \ \land \ y\in F[B]. \quad \Box \end{align\*} \\] 

We will clarify why the converse here is not true. The second arrow is not reversible, we can't go from \\( \exists x_1\in A, \ xFy \ \land \ \exists x_2\in B, \ xFy \\) into \\( \exists x\in A\cap B, \ xFy \\). Because it might be that \\( x_1\neq x_2, \ x_1\in A-B \\) and \\( x_2\in B-A \\), in which case, neither \\( x_1 \\) nor \\( x_2 \\) are in \\( A\cap B \\). Notice that if \\( F \\) is single-rooted, then \\( x_1=x_2\in A\cap B \\), in this case, the arrow is reversible.



### Is \\( \varnothing \\) a function?

Let us first ask an easier question? Is \\( \varnothing \\) a relation? Well since \\( \varnothing \subseteq A\times B \\) for whatever \\( A \\) and \\( B \\), then it certainly can be considered as one. Next, we need to check that for any \\( x\in \text{dom }\varnothing \\) there is only one \\( y\in \text{Im } \varnothing \\) such that \\( x\varnothing y \\). If we can show that \\( \text{dom }\varnothing \\) is empty, then this statement would be vacuously true.

Proof. By definition

\\[ \text{dom }\varnothing=\\{x\in \bigcup \bigcup \varnothing \ \vert \ \exists y, <x,y>\in \varnothing \\}, \\]

then realize that \\( \bigcup \bigcup \varnothing=\varnothing \\) and we are done. \\( \Box \\)

In a similar vein, \\( \text{Im }\varnothing=\varnothing \\), which means that we can assign whatever set \\( A \\) to be the codomain for \\( \varnothing \\). Hence, for any \\( A \\), there exists a function \\( f:\varnothing \to A \\), just take the empty set for a function and assign it the codomain \\( A \\).
