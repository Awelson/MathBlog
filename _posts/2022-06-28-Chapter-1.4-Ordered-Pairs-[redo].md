Note that this is a deviation to how things are normally done, but I do believe that this has some merit. We shall introduce a new axiom, not part of ZFC:

> Axiom of Ordered Pairs. If \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) are sets (or ordered pairs), we may form the object: \\( <x,y> \\), known as the ordered pair.

The ordered pair is an object that satisfies \\( <x,y>=<u,v> \\) iff \\( x=u \\) and \\( y=v \\). In particular, this means that \\( <x,y>\neq <y,x> \\) (unless \\( x=y \\)). This is why ordered pairs are called ordered pairs, the order matters. Contrast this to sets: \\( \\{x,y\\}=\\{y,x\\} \\) even for distinct \\( x \\) and \\( y \\). 

There are also operations we can perform on ordered pairs. For any ordered pair \\( <x,y> \\), we have:

\\[ \\( \text{fst}(<x,y>)=x, \quad \text{and} \quad \text{snd}(<x,y>)=y. \\]

fst takes an ordered pair and outputs the first of the two sets that make up the pair; snd outputs the second. The idea of ordered triples, quadruples, etc.. can be built from the idea of ordered pairs. For example, we can simply define the ordered triple as

\\[ <x,y,z>=<<x,y>,z>. \\]

Note that our axiom allows us to create ordered pairs with ordered pairs. Similarly, operations on the ordered triple can be built out of operations on the ordered pair. For example, the 'thd (third)' operation on an ordered triple is

\\[ \text{thd}(<x,y,z>)=\text{snd}(<<x,y>,z>)=z. \\]

The 'snd' operation on an ordered triple is

\\[ \text{snd}(<x,y,z>)=\text{snd}\circ \text{fst}(<<x,y>,z>)=y. \\]

Note that the snd operation on the left is different to the snd operation on the right. One acts on ordered triples and the other acts on ordered pairs. Try to figure out how the fst operation on triples can be constructed from the pair operations!

We now define relations:

> A relation is a set \\( R \\) such that \\( \forall x\in R. \ x \text{ is an ordered pair} \\). In other words, a relation is a set consisting of solely ordered pairs.
