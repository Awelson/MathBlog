Note that this is a deviation to how things are normally done, but I do believe that this has some merit. We shall introduce a new axiom, not part of ZFC:

> Axiom of Ordered Pairs. If \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) are sets (or ordered pairs), we may form the object: \\( <x,y> \\), known as the ordered pair.

The ordered pair is an object that satisfies \\( <x,y>=<u,v> \\) iff \\( x=u \\) and \\( y=v \\). In particular, this means that \\( <x,y>\neq <y,x> \\) (unless \\( x=y \\)). This is why ordered pairs are called ordered pairs, the order matters. Contrast this to sets: \\( \\{x,y\\}=\\{y,x\\} \\) even for distinct \\( x \\) and \\( y \\). 

There are also operations we can perform on ordered pairs. For any ordered pair \\( <x,y> \\), we have:

\\[ \\( \text{fst}(<x,y>)=x, \quad \text{and} \quad \text{snd}(<x,y>)=y. \\]

fst takes an ordered pair and outputs the first of the two sets that make up the pair; snd outputs the second. The idea of ordered triples, quadruples, etc.. can be built from the idea of ordered pairs. For example, we can simply define the ordered triple as

\\[ <x,y,z>=<<x,y>,z>. \\]

Note that our axiom allows us to create ordered pairs with ordered pairs. Similarly, operations on the ordered triple can be built out of operations on the ordered pair. For example, the 'thd (third)' operation on an ordered triple is

\\[ \text{thd}(<x,y,z>)=\text{snd}(<<x,y>,z>)=z. \\]

The 'snd' operation on an ordered triple is

\\[ \text{snd}(<x,y,z>)=\text{snd}\circ \text{fst}(<<x,y>,z>)=y. \\]

Note that the snd operation on the left is different to the snd operation on the right. One acts on ordered triples and the other acts on ordered pairs. Try to figure out how the fst operation on triples can be constructed from the pair operations!

We now define relations:

> A relation is a set \\( R \\) such that \\( \forall x\in R. \ x \text{ is an ordered pair} \\). In other words, a relation is a set of ordered pairs.

For example,

\\[ R=\\{<1,3>,<1,-4>,<0,0>\\} \\]

is an example of a relation. It is, however, a quite useless relation as it is just a meaningless collection of pairs of numbers. In defence, we could have more meaningful relations if we wanted to, for example:

\\[ R'=\\{<1,2>,<1,3>,<2,3>\\}. \\]

If \\( x,y\in \\{1,2,3\\} \\), then this relation allows us to determine whether or not \\( x<y \\). To do so, simply check whether or not \\( <x,y>\in R' \\). In particular, for all \\( x\in R' \\), \\( \text{fst}(x)<\text{snd}(x) \\). This is an example of an ordering relation, it provides information on how the elements of \\( \\{1,2,3\\} \\) should be ordered. We'll talk more about ordering relations later on.

> Note. In honesty we would need an axiom allowing ordered pairs to be placed in sets, etc... so that all this will be nice and formal but for simplicity we shall assume that we have done so already.

> Definition. For any two sets \\( A \\) and \\( B \\), the cartesian product \\( A\times B \\) is the set
\\[ A\times B=\\{ <x,y> \ \vert \ x\in A \ \land \ y\in B \\} \\]

Or alternatively:

\\[ A\times B=\\{ x \ \vert \ x \text{ is an ordered pair, }\text{fst}(x)\in A, \ \text{snd}(x)\in B \\}. \\]

In other words, it is the set of all possible combinations of elements of \\( A \\) and \\( B \\) paired up together (with elements of \\( A \\) in the first coordinate and \\( B \\) in the second). For example, if \\( A=\\{1,2} \\) and \\( B=\\{3,4\\} \\), then

\\[ A\times B=\\{<1,3>,<1,4>,<2,3>,<2,4>\\}. \\]
