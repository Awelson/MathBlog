I am going to assume that you know at least a very little bit about set theory. You should know that sets are a collection of objects and that if \\( S \\) is a set, then the statement \\( x\in S \\) means that the object '\\( x\\)' is contained inside of the set \\( S \\). You should know what an empty set is. You should know the proper notation and conventions we use to describe sets. You should know that sets can contain other sets, for example, \\( S= \\{\empty, \\{1,3,4\\} \\} \\), is a set containing the empty set and a set containing the numbers 1, 3 and 4... And so on and so forth, you get the point, just basic stuff so that we can get to the good part.

First things first, we need to set up some ground rules, and by that, I mean axioms. The first axiom I'd like to introduce will give us a way to decide whether or not two sets are equal.

> Axiom of Extension. Two sets are equal if and only if they have the same elements.

If \\( A,B \\) are two sets, then we write \\( A=B \\) to mean that they are equal, and \\( A\neq B \\) to mean that they are not. A more logically formal way to present the Axiom of Extension is as follows:

\\[ A=B \quad \Longleftrightarrow \quad \forall x\in A, \ x\in B \ \land \ \forall x\in B, x\in A. \\]

The right hand side essentially means: every element of \\( A \\) has to be in \\( B \\) **and** every element of \\( B \\) has to be in \\( A \\). Notice this is equivalent to \\( A \\) and \\( B \\) having the exact same elements.

The statement \\( \forall x\in A, x\in B \\) on its own is useful. It means that every element of \\( A \\) is in \\( B \\), whenever this is true, we say that \\( A \\) is a subset of \\( B \\), notationally, it will look like \\( A\subseteq B \\). Similarly, we write \\( B\subseteq A \\) whenever \\( \forall x\in B, x\in A \\). Notice then that

\\[ A=B \quad \Longleftrightarrow \quad A\subseteq B \ \land \ B\subseteq A. \\]

### Relations

A relation can be thought of as a 2-input function, the output is boolean, either true/false. For example, \\( = \\) is a relation between sets, we input two sets, ask whether or not they are equal, and we'll get either true or false for an output.

> Definition. Let \\( \sim \\) be a relation, then we say that \\( \sim \\) is:
- Reflexive when for any \\( x \\), \\( \ x\sim x \\).
- Symmetric when for any \\( x,y \\), \\( \ x\sim y \Longleftrightarrow y\sim x \\).
- Transitive when for any \\( x,y,z \\), \\( \ if x\sim y and y\sim z, then x\sim z \\).

It is obvious that any set \\( A \\) is a subset of itself, i.e, \\( A\subset A \\), thus \\( \subseteq \\) is reflexive (is \\( = \\) reflexive?). It is easy to see that \\( \subseteq \\) is not symmetric, take for example \\( A=\\{1\\} \\) and \\( B=\\{1,2\\} \\), then \\( A\subseteq B \\) is true, but \\( B\subseteq A \\) is not true because \\( 2\notin A \\) (is '\\( = \\)' symmetric?). Finally, there is transitivity, in order for '\\( \subseteq \\)' to satisfy this property, we must have that for any three sets, \\( A,B,C \\), if \\( A\subseteq B \\) and \\( B\subseteq C \\), then it must be that \\( A\subseteq C \\). 

> Claim. \\( \subseteq \\) is transitive.

Proof. Sal can pick any element \\( x\in A \\) to give to Kwan, in order to win (to prove that \\( A\subseteq C \\)), Kwan must show that \\( x\in C \\). Kwan knows that \\( A\subseteq B \\), so this must mean that \\( x\in B \\), but he is also aware that \\( B\subseteq C \\), so this must mean that \\( x\in C \\). \\( \Box \\)

> Show that \\( = \\) is transitive.

> \\( \in \\) can also be thought of as a relation, show whether or not it is reflexive, symmetric, and transitive. 

We will now introduce a second axiom:

> Axiom of Specification. For any set \\( A \\), we can set any condition, \\( S \\) to which the elements of \\( A \\) may or may not satisfy. There is then a set \\( B \\) containing only the elements of \\( A \\) satisfying \\( S \\).

To indicate a \\( B \\) obtained from some set \\( A \\) and condition \\( S \\) via the above axiom, we write

\\[ B=\\{x\in A \ \vert \ S(x)\\}. \\]

This literally reads, \\( B \\) is a set containing the elements \\( x\in A \\) for which \\( S(x) \\) is satisfied. For example, we can set \\( A=\mathbb{N} \\) and \\( S(x)=x\text{ is even}\\), thus

\\[ B=\\{x\in \mathbb{N} \ \vert \ x\text{ is even}\\}=\\{2,4,6,\ldots\\}. \\]

An important consequence of the axiom of specification is the following claim:

> Claim. There is no set which contains everything.

Proof. Suppose Sal claims to have found a set \\( A \\) which contains everything, Kwan however, disagrees. By invoking the axiom of specification, with \\( S(x)=x\notin x \\), there exists a set \\( B=\\{ x\in A \ \vert \ x\notin x\\} \\), a set containing only the elements of \\( A \\) which do not contain themselves. In other words,

\\[ x\in B \quad \Longleftrightarrow \quad x\in A \ \land \ x\notin x. \tag{1} \\]

Sal needs to defend the claim that \\( B\in A \\), otherwise \\( B\notin A \\), contradicting the fact that \\( A \\) contains everything. Here is how Kwan will attack: he will ask Sal whether or not \\( B\in B \\), no matter what Sal answers, he will contradict himself. 

Suppose Sal agrees that \\( B\in B \\), then by (1), we obtain \\( B\notin B \\), a contradiction. Suppose Sal disagrees, i.e, that \\( B\notin B \\), this will again lead to a contradiction because (1) gives \\( B\in B \\). \\( \Box \\)
