I am going to assume that you know at least a very little bit about set theory. You should know that sets are a collection of objects and that if \\( S \\) is a set, then the statement \\( x\in S \\) means that the object '\\( x\\)' is contained inside of the set \\( S \\). You should know what an empty set is. You should know the proper notation and conventions we use to describe sets. You should know that sets can contain other sets, for example, \\( S= \\{\empty, \\{1,3,4\\} \\} \\), is a set containing the empty set and a set containing the numbers 1, 3 and 4... And so on and so forth, you get the point, just basic stuff so that we can get to the good part.

First things first, we need to set up some ground rules, and by that, I mean axioms. The first axiom I'd like to introduce will give us a way to decide whether or not two sets are equal.

> Axiom of Extension. Two sets are equal if and only if they have the same elements.

If \\( A,B \\) are two sets, then we write \\( A=B \\) to mean that they are equal, and \\( A\neq B \\) to mean that they are not. A more logically formal way to present the Axiom of Extension is as follows:

\\[ A=B \quad \Longleftrightarrow \quad \forall x\in A, \ x\in B \ \land \ \forall x\in B, x\in A. \\]

The right hand side essentially means: every element of \\( A \\) has to be in \\( B \\) **and** every element of \\( B \\) has to be in \\( A \\). This is equivalent to \\( A \\) and \\( B \\) having the exact same elements.
