I am going to assume that you know at least a very little bit about set theory. You should know that sets are a collection of objects and that if \\( S \\) is a set, then the statement \\( x\in S \\) means that the object '\\( x\\)' is contained inside of the set \\( S \\). You should know what an empty set is. You should know the notation and conventions we use to describe sets. You should know that sets can contain other sets, for example, \\( S= \\{\empty, \\{1,3,4\\} \\} \\), is a set containing the empty set and a set containing the numbers 1, 3 and 4. And so on and so forth, you get the point, just basic stuff so that we can get to the good part.
