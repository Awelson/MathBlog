Now we may begin to talk about functions in more depth. Note, we will switch to using image instead of range as this is the more commonly accepted terminology when dealing with functions. There are two important properties relating to functions that one must understand. First is injectivity.

> Definition. We say that a function \\( f \\) is injective if for any \\( x,y\in \text{dom }f \\) we have \\( f(x)=f(y) \ \rightarrow \ x=y \\).

An alternative way to put it is, for any \\( y\in \text{ran }f \\) there must only be one \\( x\in \text{dom }f \\) such that \\( f(x)=y \\). The equivalence between these two statements is somewhat obvious.

> Example 1. The function \\( f \\) with domain \\( \mathbb{R} \\) and \\( f(x)=x^2 \\) is not injective.

This is because \\( f(-2)=f(2)=4 \\) but obviously \\( -2\neq 2 \\). However, if \\( f \\) had the domain \\( \mathbb{R}^+ \\) (the set of all positive real numbers) instead, then \\( f \\) would be injective.  

> Example 2. The function \\( f \\) with domain \\( \mathbb{R} \\) and \\( f(x)=x+1 \\) is injective.

Suppose we are given \\( x,y\in \mathbb{R} \\) such that \\( f(x)=f(y) \\). This means that \\( x+1=y+1 \\), but if so, subtracting by 1 on both sides yields \\( x=y \\).

Next is surjectivity.

> Definition. If \\( f:A\to B \\), then we say that \\( f \\) is surjective if \\( B=\text{im }f \\). Alternatively, \\( f \\) is surjective if we are able to choose any \\( y\in B \\) and in turn find an \\( x\in A \\) for which \\( f(x)=y \\) holds.

Surjectivity is a property that is only assigned to functions whose codomain has been made explicit, otherwise it wouldn't make sense to ask whether or not that function is surjective. A surjective function is easy to create, for example, let \\( f:A\to \text{im }f \\). Then \\( f \\) is automatically surjective. 

> Example 1. \\( f:[-1,2]\to [0,4] \\) with \\( f(x)=x^2 \\) is surjective.

Choose a \\( y\in [0,4] \\). Clearly \\( \sqrt{y}\in A \\) and also \\( f(\sqrt{y})=y \\) so \\( f \\) is indeed surjective.
