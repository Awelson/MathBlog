Now we may begin to talk about functions in more depth. There are two important properties relating to functions that one must understand. First is injectivity.

> Definition. We say that a function \\( f \\) is injective if for any \\( x,y\in \text{dom }f \\) we have \\( f(x)=f(y) \ \rightarrow \ x=y \\).

An alternative way to put it is, for any \\( y\in \text{ran }f \\) there must only be one \\( x\in \text{dom }f \\) such that \\( f(x)=y \\). The equivalence between these two statements is somewhat obvious.

> Example 1. The function \\( f \\) with domain \\( \mathbb{R} \\) and \\( f(x)=x^2 \\) is not injective.

This is because \\( f(-2)=f(2)=4 \\) but obviously \\( -2\neq 2 \\). If \\( f \\) had the domain \\( \mathbb{R}^+ \\) (the set of all positive real numbers) instead, then \\( f \\) would be injective.  

> Example 2. The function \\( f \\) with domain \\( \mathbb{R} \\) and \\( f(x)=x+1 \\) is injective.

Suppose we are given \\( x,y\in \mathbb{R} \\) such that \\( f(x)=f(y) \\). This means that \\( x+1=y+1 \\), but if so, this implies \\( x=y \\).
