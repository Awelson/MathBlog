The 'cardinality' of a set is a way of talking about the size of a set. Intuitively, we can say that \\( \omega \\) is a larger set than, say \\( \\{1,3,5\\} \\). The issue arises when we want to compare the cardinality of two infinite sets. This matter is solved by formalizing the notion of cardinality:

> Definition. We say that two sets \\( A \\) and \\( B \\) have equal cardinality iff there exists a bijection \\( f:A\to B \\). We write \\( A\approx B \\) for two sets with equal cardinality

For example, the set \\( \\{1,2,5\\} \\) and the set \\( \\{0,3,7\\} \\) have equal cardinality. The existence of a bijection between these two sets is obvious. Sometimes things get a bit more hazy: the sets \\( \mathbb{N} \\) and \\( \mathbb{N}\times \mathbb{N} \\) have equal cardinality according to our definition, although intuitively the latter is a lot larger than the former. The Cantor Pairing function is one example of a bijection between \\( \mathbb{N^2} \\) and \\( \mathbb{N} \\) (see https://www.math.drexel.edu/~tolya/cantorpairing.pdf).

> Theorem 2.5.1 For any three sets \\( A,B,C \\) the three statements are true:
\\[ A\approx A, \quad A\approx B \ \Longleftrightarrow \ B\approx A, \quad \text{and} \quad A\approx B \ \land \ B\approx C \ \rightarrow A\approx C. \\]

Proof. If we prove this, this means that \\( \approx \\) is an equivalence relation. The first is equivalent to saying that there always exists a bijection from \\( A \\) to itself. Clearly \\( Id_A:A\to A \\) fits the bill. 

The second states that if there exists a bijection \\( f:A\to B \\), then there exists a bijection \\( f:B\to A \\). By Theorem 1.5.3, we know that \\( f^{-1} \\) is an injective function. Also, \\( \text{dom }f^{-1}=\text{Im }f=B \\). And similarly, \\( \text{Im }f^{-1}=\text{dom }f=A \\). This is by virtue of Lemma 1.5.1. Thus, \\( f^{-1}:B\to A \\) is a bijective function.

The thirs states that if there exists a bijection \\( g:A\to B \\) and a bijection \\( f:B\to C \\), then there exists a bijection \\( h:A\to C \\). We propose that \\( h=f\circ g \\). By Theorem 1.5.5, \\( h \\) is a function with domain \\( \\{ x\in A \ \vert \ g(x)\in B \\} \\). But notice that this set is simply just \\( A \\).  

Our main goal here will be to prove Cantor's theorem: For any set \\( A \\), there is no bijection between \\( A \\) and \\( \mathcal{P}(A) \\). Thus, these two sets don't have the same cardinality. For this, we employ the following lemma:

> Lemma 2.5.2. For any set \\( A \\), there is a bijection between \\( \mathcal{P}(A) \\) and \\( \\{0,1\\}^A \\).

Proof. Recall that \\( A^B \\) is the set of functions \\( f:B\to A \\). A function from \\( \mathcal{P}(A) \\) to \\( \\{0,1\\}^A \\) is essentially an assignment of a subset of \\( A \\) to a function that maps elements of \\( A \\) to either zero or one. We generate this assignment as follows: If \\( S\subseteq A \\), then let \\( H(S) \\) be the function

\\[ H_S(x)=\begin{cases} 1 &\text{ if }x\in S \newline 0 &\text{ otherwise} \end{cases}. \\]

\\( H(S) \\) is known as the characteristic function of \\( S \\). We know that \\( H \\) has to be injective because: Suppose that \\( H_A=H_B \\). If \\( x\in A \\) then \\( H_A(x)=H_B(x)=1 \\), thus it must be that \\( x\in B \\) as well. Similarly, we prove \\( x\in B\to x\in A \\) as well. This all means that \\( A=B \\) as required.

To prove surjectivity: suppose \\( f\in \\{0,1\\}^A \\), then the subset

\\[ S=\\{ x\in A \ \vert \ f(x)=1 \\} \\]

satisfies \\( H_S=f \\). By definition \\( H_S(x)=1 \\) if \\( x\in S \ \Longleftrightarrow \ f(x)=1 \\). Similarly, \\( H_S(x)=0 \\) if \\( x\notin S \ \Longleftrightarrow \ f(x)=0 \\). \\( \Box \\)

> Theorem 2.5.2. [Cantor] For any set \\( A \\), there is no bijection between \\( A \\) and \\( \mathcal{P}(A) \\). 

Proof. Suppose there is a bijection from \\( f:A\to \mathcal{P}(A) \\), then there is a bijection \\( e:A\to \\{0,1\\}^A \\) by transitivity. Let \\( s\in \\{0,1\\}^A \\) be defined as follows: \\( s(x)=\neg(\[e(x)\](x)) \\) (where \\( \neg(0)=1 \\) and \\( \neg(1)=0 \\)). Since \\( e \\) is surjective, there exists a \\( y\in A \\) such that \\( e(y)=s \\). 

The contradiction appears if we consider \\( \[e(y)\](y)=s(y)=\neg(\[e(y)\](y)) \\). This is a contradiction because \\( \neg(a)=a \\) is impossible, it has no fixed points. \\( \Box \\)

> Sidenote. A fixed point of a function \\( f \\) is an \\( x\in \text{dom }f \\) such that \\( f(x)=x \\).

Cantor's Theorem actually has a nice generalization, it is known as the Lawvere fixed point theorem:

> Theorem 2.5.3. [Lawvere] For any sets \\( A,B \\), if there is a surjective function \\( e:A\to B^A \\), then every function \\( f:B\to B \\) has a fixed point.

Proof. Let \\( s\in B^A \\) be a function defined by \\( s(x)=f(\[e(x)\](x)) \\). Since \\( e \\) is surjective, there is a \\( y\in A \\) such that \\( e(y)=s \\). Thus, \\( \[e(y)\](y)=s(y)=f(\[e(y)\](y)) \\). So \\( y \\) is a fixed point of \\( f \\). \\( \Box \\)

This theorem has some nice consequences, here is one of them:

> Corollary 2.5.3.1. \\( \omega \not\approx \omega^\omega \\). In other words: \\( \omega \\) does not have the same cardinality as the set of functions mapping from \\( \omega \\) to \\( \omega \\).

Proof. Let \\( A=B=\omega \\) in Lawvere's theorem. Suppose \\( \omega\approx \omega^\omega \\), then there exists a bijection (which clearly is also a surjection) \\( e:\omega\to \omega^\omega \\). This tells us that every function \\( f:\omega\to \omega \\) has a fixed point. But the succesor function \\( \sigma(n)=n^+ \\) clearly has no fixed point; this is a contraditcion. \\( \Box \\)
