The 'cardinality' of a set is a way of talking about the size of a set. Intuitively, we can say that \\( \omega \\) is a larger set than, say \\( \\{1,3,5\\} \\). The issue arises when we want to compare the cardinality of two infinite sets. This matter is solved by formalizing the notion of cardinality:

> Definition. We say that two sets \\( A \\) and \\( B \\) have equal cardinality iff there exists a bijection \\( f:A\to B \\).

For example, the set \\( \\{1,2,5\\} \\) and the set \\( \\{0,3,7\\} \\) have equal cardinality. The existence of a bijection between these two sets is obvious. Sometimes things get a bit more hazy: the sets \\( \mathbb{N} \\) and \\( \mathbb{N}\times \mathbb{N} \\) have equal cardinality according to our definition, although intuitively the latter is a lot larger than the former. The Cantor Pairing function is one example of a bijection between \\( \mathbb{N^2} \\) and \\( \mathbb{N} \\) (see https://www.math.drexel.edu/~tolya/cantorpairing.pdf).

Our main goal here will be to prove Cantor's theorem: For any set \\( A \\), there is no bijection between \\( A \\) and \\( \mathcal{P}(A) \\). Thus, these two sets don't have the same cardinality. For this, we employ several lemmas:

> Lemma 2.5.1. For any set \\( A \\), there is a bijection between \\( \mathcal{P}(A) \\) and \\( \\{0,1\\}^A \\).

Proof. Recall that \\( A^B \\) is the set of functions \\( f:B\to A \\). A function from \\( \mathcal{P}(A) \\) to \\( \\{0,1\\}^A \\) is essentially an assignment of a subset of \\( A \\) to a function that maps elements of \\( A \\) to either zero or one. We generate this assignment as follows: If \\( S\subseteq A \\), then let \\( H(S) \\) be the function

\\[ H_S(x)=\begin{cases} 1 &\text{ if }x\in S \newline 0 &\text{ otherwise} \end{cases}. \\]
