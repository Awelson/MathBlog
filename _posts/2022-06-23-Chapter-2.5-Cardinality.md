The 'cardinality' of a set is a way of talking about the size of a set. Intuitively, we can say that \\( \omega \\) is a larger set than, say \\( \\{1,3,5\\} \\). The issue arises when we want to compare the cardinality of two infinite sets. This matter is solved by formalizing the notion of cardinality:

> Definition. We say that two sets \\( A \\) and \\( B \\) have equal cardinality iff there exists a bijection \\( f:A\to B \\).

For example, the set \\( \\{1,2,5\\} \\) and the set \\( \\{0,3,7\\} \\) have equal cardinality. It is easy to construct a bijection between these two sets. Sometimes things get a bit more hazy: the sets \\( \mathbb{N} \\) and \\( \mathbb{N}\times \mathbb{N} \\) have equal cardinality according to our definition, although intuitively the latter is a lot larger than the former.
