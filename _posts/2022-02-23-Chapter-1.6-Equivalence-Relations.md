A partition of a non-empty set \\( A \\) is a collection \\( \mathcal{C} \\) of non-empty subsets of \\( A \\) such that

- \\( \bigcup \mathcal{C}=A \\)
- For any distinct \\( X,Y\in \mathcal{C}, \ X\cap Y=\varnothing \\)

For example, if \\( A=\\{1,2,3\\} \\) then \\( \mathcal{C}_1=\\{\\{1\\},\\{2,3\\}\\} \\) is a partition of \\( A \\). Another example is \\( \mathcal{C}_2=\\{\\{1,2\\},\\{3\\}\\} \\). For any set \\( A \\) there is the trivial partition \\( \mathcal{C}=\\{A\\} \\) and \\( \mathcal{C}=\\{\\{a\\} \ \vert \ a\in A\\} \\).

Given a set \\( A \\) and a partition \\( \mathcal{C} \\) one can define a relation \\( R\subseteq A\times A \\) such that \\( xRy \\) iff \\( x,y\in X \\) for some \\( X\in \mathcal{C} \\). A relation created in this way is said to be an equivalence relation on \\( A \\). Notice that we have touched on the concept of equivalence relations early on, the difference now is that we are looking at things in a set theoretic perspective.

Example: If \\( A=\\{1,2,3\\} \\) and \\( \mathcal{C}=\\{\\{1,2\\},\\{3\\} \\), then the equivalence relation formed is

\\[ R=\\{<1,1>,<1,2>,<2,1>,<2,2>,<3,3>\\}. \\]

> Theorem 1.6.1 An equivalence relation \\( R \\) on a set \\( A \\) satisfies the following
- Reflexive: \\( xRx \\) for all \\( x\in A \\).
- Symmetric: For all \\( x,y\in A \\), \\( \ xRy \ \Longleftrightarrow \ yRx \\).
- Transitive: For all \\( x,y,z\in A \\), \\( \ xRy \ \land \ yRz \ \Longleftrightarrow \ xRz \\).

Proof. Reflexive and symmetric properties are obvious, so we will prove the transitive property only. Suppose both \\( xRy \\) and \\( yRz \\), this means that there are subsets \\( X,Y\subseteq A \\) from a partition \\( \mathcal{C} \\) for which \\( x,y\in X \\) and \\( y,z \in Y \\). Notice that \\( y\in X\cap Y \\) so the intersection is nonempty. This necessitates \\( X=Y \\), and \\( xRz \\) is obvious from here. \\( \Box \\)

We now would like to prove the converse, that is, if \\( R\subseteq A\times A \\) is a relation that is reflexive, symmetric, and transitive (an RST relation on \\( A \\)), then \\( R \\) is an equivalence relation on \\( A \\). How can we prove whether or not an RST relation, \\( R \\), is also an equivalence relation? We would need to show that there exists a partition, \\( \mathcal{C} \\) of \\( A \\) such that the relation generated from this partition equals \\( R \\).

To this end we shall generate the notion of an RST class. Let \\( R \\) be an RST relation on \\( A \\), then for each \\( x\in A \\) we define the RST class of \\( x \\) (modulo \\( R \\)) as follows:

\\[ [x]_R=\\{ t\in A \ \vert \ xRt \\} \\]

The existence of \\( [x]_R \\) follows by filtering from \\( \text{im }R=A \\). Similarly, We can also form the set \\( \\{[x]_R \ \vert \ x\in A \\} \\) by filtering from \\( \mathcal{P}(A) \\). Our goal is to show that this set is the partition we are looking for.

Before moving on to the theorems and lemmas, lets look at an example:

> Let \\( A=\mathbb{N} \\) and \\( R\subseteq A\times A \\) be a relation defined by \\( xRy \\) if either both \\( x,y \\) are even or both are odd. Then \\( R \\) is an RST relation on \\( A \\), you should try check this for yourself.

Let us examine the RST classes which stem from this example: \\( [1]_R \\) would by definition be the set of all \\( x\in \mathbb{N} \\) such that \\( 1Rx \\). It is easy to notice then that

\\[ [1]_R=\\{1,3,5,7,\ldots\\}, \\]

the set of all odd numbers. In general, \\( [x]_R=\\{1,3,5,\ldots\\} \\) whenever \\( x \\) is odd. Similarly, \\( [y]_R=\\{2,4,6,\ldots\\} \\) whenever \\( y \\) is even. Therefore,

\\[ \\{[x]_R \ \vert \ x\in A \\}=\\{\\{1,3,5,\ldots\\},\\{2,4,6,\ldots\\}\\}. \\]

Notice that this creates a partition of \\( \mathbb{N} \\).

> Lemma 1.6.2 Let \\( R \\) be an RST relation on a set \\( A \\). If \\( a_1,a_2\in A \\), then \\( a_1Ra_2 \\) iff \\( [a_1]_R=[a_2]_R \\).

Proof. Suppose \\( a_1Ra_2 \\). Choose an \\( x\in [a_1]_R \\), then \\( a_1Rx \\). Combine this with our assumption (and that \\( R \\) is symmetric and transitive), we get \\( a_2Rx \\) so \\( x\in [a_2]_R \\). This shows \\( [a_1]_R\subseteq [a_2]_R \\). The converse is proved similarly.

Now suppose \\( [a_1]_R=[a_2]_R \\). By reflexivity, \\( a_2\in [a_2]_R=[a_1]_R \\) so \\( a_1Ra_2 \\) as needed. \\( \Box \\)

> Theorem 1.6.3 If \\( R\subseteq A\times A \\) is an RST relation, then \\( \mathcal{C}=\\{[x]_R \ \vert \ x\in A \\} \\) forms a partition of \\( A \\).

Proof. Notice that since \\( R \\) is reflexive we have \\( x\in [x]_R \\) for all \\( x\in A \\), so \\( \mathcal{C} \\) indeed consists of non-empty subsets of \\( A \\). We now prove the first condition: 

\\( \bigcup\mathcal{C} \subseteq A \\) is already obvious, so we only need to prove the converse. Choose an \\( a\in A \\), then \\( a\in [a]_R\subseteq \bigcup\mathcal{C} \\). This proves the converse. We now prove the second condition:

Suppose there are distinct \\( X,Y\in \mathcal{C} \\) such that \\( X\cap Y\neq \varnothing \\). This means that there is an \\( a\in A \\) such that \\( a\in X,Y \\). We have \\( X=[a_1]_R \\) and \\( Y=[a_2]_R \\) for some \\( a_1,a_2\in A \\). So \\( a_1Ra \\) and \\( a_2Ra \\). By symmetry and transitivity, we have \\( a_1Ra_2 \\). The lemma tells us that \\( [a_1]_R=[a_2]_R \\), a contradiction. \\( \Box \\)

Continuing on, we need to show that the equivalence relation (we shall call it \\( R' \\)) generated from this partition is equivalent to the RST relation \\( R \\). \\( R' \\) is given as follows:

\\[ xR'y \quad \Longleftrightarrow \quad x,y\in [z]_{R} \ \text{for some }z\in A \\]

but this is equivalent to \\( zRx \\) and \\( zRy \\), which by symmetry and transitivity gives \\( xRy \\) so \\( R \\) and \\( R' \\) are equivalent. In essence, we have shown that given a set \\( A \\) and an RST relation \\( R \\) on \\( A \\), we can generate a partition of \\( A \\) (by this we mean the set \\( \\{[x]_R \ \vert \ x\in A\\} \\)) such that the equivalence relation generated from this partition equals \\( R \\). The converse (Theorem 1.6.1) is true as well. Given a set \\( A \\) and a partition \\( \mathcal{C} \\) of \\( A \\), the equivalence relation generated from this partition satsifies reflexivity, symmetry, and transitivity. Hence, it is also simultaneously an RST relation.

Since we have shown that an equivalence relation is equivalent with an RST relation, let us decide to rename the "RST class", we will now use the word "equivalence class" instead. We will also opt for using "equivalence relation" in place of "RST relation". This is the general convention.

### Quotient Sets

If \\( R \\) is an equivalence relation on \\( A \\), then we define the quotient set,

\\[ A/R=\\{[x]_R \ \vert \ x\in A\\}. \\]

In other words, \\( A/R \\) is simply the partition of \\( A \\) that is generated from the equivalence relation \\( R \\). We can also form a canonical mapping \\( \varphi:A\to A/R \\) defined by

\\[ \varphi(x)=[x]_R, \quad \text{for all }x\in A. \\]

It sends an element \\( x\in A \\) to whichever equivalence class it belongs.

### Equivalence Relation from a Function

Suppose we have a function \\( F:A\to B \\), then we can define a relation on \\( A \\) as follows:

\\[ xRy \quad \Longleftrightarrow \quad F(x)=F(y). \\]

It is easy to check that this is in fact an equivalence relation on \\( A \\). We can do this either by showing that \\( A/R \\) forms a partition, or by showing that \\( R \\) satisfies reflexivity, symmetry, and transitivity. There is a unique function \\( \hat{F}:A/R\to B \\) such that \\( F=\hat{F}\circ \varphi \\) (where \\( \varphi \\) is the canonical map from \\( A\to A/R \\) we just talked about). One way to define \\( \hat{F} \\) so that \\( F=\hat{F}\circ \varphi \\) is satisfied is as follows:

\\[ \hat{F}([x]_R)=F(x), \quad \text{for all }x\in A \\]

Care needs to be taken to ensure that this is well-defined, i.e, that if \\( [x]_R=[y]_R \\), then we must have \\( F(x)=F(y) \\). An equivalent way to define \\( \hat{F} \\) is with the following transformation procedure:

- To transform \\( [x]_R\in A/R \\) into an element of \\( B \\), first choose randomly an element \\( a\in [x]_R \\). Then apply \\( F \\) to that element. Hence, \\( \hat{F}([x]_R)=F(a) \\) where \\( a \\) is some random element from \\( [x]_R \\). 

Whichever element we end up choosing won't have an effect. They are all in the same equivalence class so we know that \\( F \\) maps them to the same element anyway. This way of thinking does require us to use the axiom of choice, having the ability to choose a random element from \\( [x]_R\in A/R \\) amounts to extracting a function out of \\( \varphi^{-1} \\). More specifically, \\( \varphi^{-1}([x]_R) \\) is a random element from \\( [x]_R \\) (supposing \\( \varphi^{-1} \\) has already been turned into a function).

> We still haven't shown that this is the only possible way to define \\( \hat{F} \\). Try to prove this on your own.

We shall use concrete example to illustrate. If \\( F:\mathbb{R}\to \mathbb{R}, \ F(x)=x^2 \\). Then the relation \\( R \\) contains the ordered pairs \\( <x,y>\in \mathbb{R}\times \mathbb{R} \\) satisfying \\( x^2=y^2 \\). An example of such an order pair is \\( \ <2,-2> \\), another is \\( <0,0> \\), etc... This relation is of course an equivalence relation.

With this relation, we can generate the quotient set \\( \mathbb{R}/R \\). It is not too hard to realize that

\\[ \mathbb{R}/R=\\{\\{x,-x\\} \ \vert \ x\in \mathbb{R}^+\\}. \\]

Note: \\( \mathbb{R}^+=[0,\infty) \\). This does form a partition of \\( \mathbb{R} \\). In this situation, \\( \hat{F} \\) maps \\( \\{x,-x\\}\to x^2, \ x\in \mathbb{R}^+ \\). Meanwhile, \\( \varphi, \ x\to \\{x,-x\\}, \ x\in \mathbb{R} \\).

### A Function \\( \hat{F}:A/R\to A/R \\)

Given a function \\( F:A\to A \\) and an equivalence relation \\( R \\), we wish to see if it is possible for there to exist a function \\( \hat{F}:A/R\to A/R \\) such that

\\[ \hat{F}([x]_R)=[F(x)]_R, \quad \text{for all }x\in A. \\]

One attempt is to try setting \\( \hat{F}=\varphi\circ F\circ \varphi^{-1} \\) (supposing \\( \varphi^{-1} \\) has already been turned into a function). This attempt makes sense if we were to look at the diagram below.

![Capture.PNG](/MathBlog/assets/Capture19.PNG)

We now need to verify that

\\[ \varphi\circ F\circ \varphi^{-1}([x]_R)=[F(x)]_R, \quad \text{for all }x\in A. \tag{1} \\]

Before we do that, let us address a problem. Say \\( [x]_R \\) is an equivalence class of \\( A \\) and \\( x_1,x_2\in [x]_R \\), then on one instance we may have \\( \varphi^{-1}([x]_R)=x_1 \\) and on another we may have \\( \varphi^{-1}([x]_R)=x_2 \\). To make sure that our definition of \\( \hat{F} \\) is well defined, we need to show that \\( \varphi(F(x_1))=\varphi(F(x_2)) \\), i.e, that \\( F(x_1) \\) and \\( F(x_2) \\) are in the same equivalence class. This however is not guaranteed every single time.

So we conclude \\( \hat{F} \\) is well defined if: for any \\( x_1,x_2\in A \\), \\( \ x_1Rx_2 \\) implies \\( F(x_1)RF(x_2) \\). I.e, if \\( x_1,x_2 \\) are in the same equivalence class, then so should \\( F(x_1),F(x_2) \\). 

We shall say that a function \\( F:A\to A \\) is compatible if the above implication holds. For arguments sake let us assume that \\( F \\) is compatible, so \\( \hat{F} \\) is well defined. We still need to verify that (1) holds. First, notice that

\\[ \varphi\circ F\circ \varphi^{-1}([x]_R)=[F(\varphi^{-1}([x]_R))]_R \\]

so equality holds if \\( F(\varphi^{-1}([x]_R)) \\) and \\( F(x) \\) are contained in the same equivalence class. But since \\( \varphi^{-1}([x]_R) \\) and \\( x \\) are by definition in the same equivalence class, our assumption that \\( F \\) is compatible implies that \\( F(\varphi^{-1}([x]_R)) \\) and \\( F(x) \\) are in the same equivalence class as needed. So not only is compatibility needed to make sure that \\( \hat{F} \\) is well defined, it is also a necessary condition for (1) to hold as well.

Example: Let \\( F:\mathbb{N}\to \mathbb{N}, \ F(n)=2n \\) and \\( R \\) be a relation so that \\( xRy \\) if \\( x-y \\) is divisible by 6. First, confirm that this is an equivalence relation on \\( \mathbb{N} \\). Next, confirm that if \\( xRy \\) then \\( 2xR2y \\), this shows that \\( F \\) is compatible. Both of these are easy to show.

The above tells us that there exists a function \\( \hat{F}:\mathbb{N}/R\to \mathbb{N}/R \\) such that \\( \hat{F}([x]_R)=[2x]_R \\) for all \\( x\in \mathbb{N} \\). Of course, we already know how to construct such a function, let us try applying \\( \hat{F} \\) to \\( [1]_R \\). The first step is to choose a random element from 

\\[ [1]_R=\\{1,7,13,19,\ldots\\} \\]

Let us pick 7. Now applying \\( F \\) gives 14, and applying \\( \varphi \\) gives \\( [14]_R \\). We expected \\( [2]_R \\), but this is not failure. It may just be that \\( [14]_R=[2]_R \\). Indeed this is the case since \\( 14-2=12 \\) is divisible by 6 so \\( 14R2 \\). Notice that nothing would have changed if we had chosen a different element from \\( [1]_R \\) instead.

An example of a function that is not compatible is \\( F(n)=2^n \\). For example, \\( 0R6 \\) is true but \\( 1R64 \\) is not. Having a function so that \\( \hat{F}([n]_R)=[2^n]_R \\) is impossible because we must have \\( \hat{F}([0]_R)=[1]_R \\) and \\( \hat{F}([6]_R)=[32]_R \\) and since \\( [0]_R=[6]_R \\) we must have \\( [1]_R=[32]_R \\) <- but this is simply not the case.

### Ordering Relations

Although this section has nothing to do with equivalence relations, it is short enough that I feel it does not deserve a whole page to itself so here it is.

The idea is: We can build a relation \\( R\subseteq A\times A \\) so that from this relation, we can determine if an element \\( a\in A \\) is lesser than some other element \\( b\in A \\). To check, simply determine if \\( <a,b>\in R \\), if so, then \\( a \\) is less than \\( b \\). Such a relation is called an ordering relation.

This makes more sense with the example: Let \\( A=\\{2,3,5\\} \\) and

\\[ R=\\{<2,3>,<2,5>,<3,5>\\}. \\]

Recall, we have given the same example previously. Right now, we are just exploring this example from a much deeper point of view. For example, if we want to know if \\( 2<5 \\), we can check if \\( <2,5>\in R \\), indeed it is, so know for sure that \\( 2<5 \\).

Of course, we have the question: How do we know that

\\[ R=\\{<2,3>,<2,5>,<3,5>\\} \\]

is the "correct" way to construct an ordering relation on \\( A \\)? What about \\( \hat{R}=\\{<2,2>,<3,2>,<2,5>\\} \\)? What makes this more wrong or less correct than \\( R \\)? For one, let \\( R \\) be an ordering relation on \\( A \\), then for any \\( x\in A, \ <x,x>\in R \\) must never hold. If this were the case, then that would imply that \\( x<x \\) which does not make sense. Further if \\( <x,y>,<y,z>\in R \\), then we must have \\( \ <x,z>\in R \\). This is because we want to incorporate the idea that \\( x<y<z \\) implies \\( x<z \\). Notice that \\( \hat{R} \\) does not satisfy these conditions, so this does not constitue a "correct" ordering relation on \\( A \\).

Let us now provide a formal definition for an ordering relation: Let \\( A \\) be a set. Then a linear ordering on \\( A \\) is a relation \\( R\subseteq A\times A \\) satisfying the following two conditions:

- \\( R \\) must be transitive, i.e, if \\( xRy \\) and \\( yRz \\), then we must have \\( xRz \\)
- \\( R \\) satisfies trichotomy, that is, for any \\( x,y\in A \\), exactly one of these three is true

\\[ xRy, \quad x=y, \quad yRx. \\]

Notice that \\( \forall x\in A, \ \neg(xRx) \\) does not appear in the list of conditions. Instead, this is a fact that follows from trichotomy. We also say linear order because there are other types of order and we wish to distinguish between them later on.

> Theorem 1.6.4. If \\( R \\) is a linear ordering on \\( A \\), then for any \\( x\in A, \ xRx \\) never holds.

Proof. Let\ \\(x\in A \\). By trichotomy, exactly one of these three is true:

\\[ xRx, \quad x=x, \quad xRx. \\]

Since \\( x=x \\) is definetly correct, it must be that \\( xRx \\) is false. \\( \Box \\)
