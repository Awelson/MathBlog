A partition of a non-empty set \\( A \\) is a collection \\( \mathcal{C} \\) of non-empty subsets of \\( A \\) such that

- \\( \bigcup \mathcal{C}=A \\)
- For any distinct \\( X,Y\in \mathcal{C}, \ X\cap Y=\varnothing \\)

For example, if \\( A=\\{1,2,3\\} \\) then \\( \mathcal{C}_1=\\{\\{1\\},\\{2,3\\}\\} \\) is a partition of \\( A \\). Another example is \\( \mathcal{C}_2=\\{\\{1,2\\},\\{3\\}\\} \\). For any set \\( A \\) there is the trivial partition \\( \mathcal{C}=\\{A\\} \\) and \\( \mathcal{C}=\\{\\{a\\} \ \vert \ a\in A\\} \\).

Given a set \\( A \\) and a partition \\( \mathcal{C} \\) one can define a relation \\( R\subseteq A\times A \\) such that \\( xRy \\) iff \\( x,y\in X \\) for some \\( X\in \mathcal{C} \\). A relation created in this way is said to be an equivalence relation on \\( A \\). Notice that we have touched on the concept of equivalence relations early on, the difference now is that we are looking at things in a set theoretic perspective.

Example: If \\( A=\\{1,2,3\\} \\) and \\( \mathcal{C}=\\{\\{1,2\\},\\{3\\} \\), then the equivalence relation formed is

\\[ R=\\{<1,1>,<1,2>,<2,1>,<2,2>,<3,3>\\}. \\]

> Theorem 1.6.1 An equivalence relation \\( R \\) on a set \\( A \\) satisfies the following
- Reflexive: \\( xRx \\) for all \\( x\in A \\).
- Symmetric: For all \\( x,y\in A \\), \\( \ xRy \ \Longleftrightarrow \ yRx \\).
- Transitive: For all \\( x,y,z\in A \\), \\( \ xRy \ \land \ yRz \ \Longleftrightarrow \ xRz \\).

Proof. Reflexive and symmetric properties are obvious, so we will prove the transitive property only. Suppose both \\( xRy \\) and \\( yRz \\), this means that there are subsets \\( X,Y\subseteq A \\) from a partition \\( \mathcal{C} \\) for which \\( x,y\in X \\) and \\( y,z \in Y \\). Notice that \\( y\in X\cap Y \\) so the intersection is nonempty. This necessitates \\( X=Y \\), and \\( xRz \\) is obvious from here. \\( \Box \\)

We now would like to prove the converse, that is, if \\( R\subseteq A\times A \\) is a relation that is reflexive, symmetric, and transitive (an RST relation), then \\( R \\) is an equivalence relation on \\( A \\). How can we prove whether or not an RST relation, \\( R \\), is an equivalence relation? We would need to show that there exists a partition, \\( \mathcal{C} \\) of \\( A \\) such that the relation generated from this equals \\( R \\).

To this end we shall generate the notion of an RST class. Let \\( R\subseteq A\times A \\) be an RST relation, then for each \\( x\in A \\) we define the RST class of \\( x \\) (modulo \\( R \\)) as follows:

\\[ [x]_R=\\{ t\in A \ \vert \ xRt \\} \\]

The existence of \\( [x]_R \\) follows by filtering from \\( \text{im }R=A \\). Similarly, We can also form the set \\( \\{[x]_R \ \vert \ x\in A \\} \\) by filtering from \\( \mathcal{P}(A) \\). Our goal is to show that this set is the partition we are looking for.

> Lemma 1.6.2 Let \\( R\subseteq A\times A \\) be an RST relation and \\( a_1,a_2\in A \\). Then \\( a_1Ra_2 \\) iff \\( [a_1]_R=[a_2]_R \\).

Proof. Suppose \\( a_1Ra_2 \\). Choose an \\( x\in [a_1]_R \\), then \\( a_1Rx \\). Combine this with the fact that \\( a_1Ra_2 \\) + symmetry + transitivity, we get \\( a_2Rx \\) so \\( x\in [a_2]_R \\). This shows \\( [a_1]_R\subseteq [a_2]_R \\). The converse is proved similarly.

Now suppose \\( [a_1]_R=[a_2]_R \\). By reflexivity, \\( a_2\in [a_2]_R=[a_1]_R \\) so \\( a_1Ra_2 \\) as needed. \\( \Box \\)

> Theorem 1.6.3 If \\( R\subseteq A\times A \\) is an RST relation, then \\( \mathcal{C}=\\{[x]_R \ \vert \ x\in A \\} \\) forms a partition of \\( A \\).

Proof. Notice that since \\( R \\) is reflexive we have \\( x\in [x]_R \\) for all \\( x\in A \\), so \\( \mathcal{C} \\) indeed consists of non-empty subsets of \\( A \\). We now prove the first condition: 

\\( \bigcup\mathcal{C} \subseteq A \\) is already obvious, so we only need to prove the converse. Choose an \\( a\in A \\), then \\( a\in [a]_R\subseteq \bigcup\mathcal{C} \\). This proves the converse. We now prove the second condition:

Suppose there are distinct \\( X,Y\in \mathcal{C} \\) such that \\( X\cap Y\neq \varnothing \\). This means that there is an \\( a\in A \\) such that \\( a\in X,Y \\). We have \\( X=[a_1]_R \\) and \\( Y=[a_2]_R \\) for some \\( a_1,a_2\in A \\). So \\( a_1Ra \\) and \\( a_2Ra \\). By symmetry and transitivity, we have \\( a_1Ra_2 \\). The lemma tells us that \\( [a_1]_R=[a_2]_R \\), a contradiction. \\( \Box \\)

Next we need to show that the relation generated from \\( \mathcal{C} \\) (we shall call it \\( R' \\) is equivalent to \\( R \\). \\( R' \\) is given as follows:

\\[ xR'y \quad \Longleftrigtharrow \quad x,y\in [z]_{R} \ \text{for some }z\in A \\]

but this is equivalent to \\( zRx \\) and \\( zRy \\), which by symmetry and transitivity gives \\( xRy \\) as we want.
