A partition of a set \\( A \\) is a collection \\( X \\) of non-empty subsets of \\( A \\) such that

- \\( \bigcup X=A \\)
- An element \\( a\in A \\) cannot be in more than one of these subsets

For example, if \\( A=\\{1,2,3\\} \\) then \\( X_1=\\{\\{1\\},\\{2,3\\}\\} \\) is a partition of \\( A \\). Another example is \\( X_2=\\{\\{1,2\\},\\{3\\}\\} \\). For any set \\( A \\), there is the trivial partition \\( X=\\{A\\} \\) and \\( X=\\{\\{a\\} \ \vert \ a\in A\\} \\).
