A partition of a non-empty set \\( A \\) is a collection \\( \mathcal{C} \\) of non-empty subsets of \\( A \\) such that

- \\( \bigcup \mathcal{C}=A \\)
- For any distinct \\( X,Y\in \mathcal{C}, \ X\cap Y=\varnothing \\)

For example, if \\( A=\\{1,2,3\\} \\) then \\( \mathcal{C}_1=\\{\\{1\\},\\{2,3\\}\\} \\) is a partition of \\( A \\). Another example is \\( \mathcal{C}_2=\\{\\{1,2\\},\\{3\\}\\} \\). For any set \\( A \\) there is the trivial partition \\( \mathcal{C}=\\{A\\} \\) and \\( \mathcal{C}=\\{\\{a\\} \ \vert \ a\in A\\} \\).

Given a set \\( A \\) and a partition \\( \mathcal{C} \\) one can define a relation \\( R\subseteq A\times A \\) such that \\( xRy \\) iff \\( x,y\in X \\) for some \\( X\in \mathcal{C} \\). A relation created in this way is said to be an equivalence relation on \\( A \\). Notice that we have touched on the concept of equivalence relations early on, the difference now is that we are looking at things in a set theoretic perspective.

Example: If \\( A=\\{1,2,3\\} \\) and \\( \mathcal{C}=\\{\\{1,2\\},\\{3\\} \\), then the equivalence relation formed is

\\[ R=\\{<1,1>,<1,2>,<2,1>,<2,2>,<3,3>\\}. \\]

> Theorem 1.6.1 An equivalence relation \\( R \\) on a set \\( A \\) satisfies the following
- Reflexive: \\( xRx \\) for all \\( x\in A \\).
- Symmetric: For all \\( x,y\in A \\), \\( \ xRy \ \Longleftrightarrow \ yRx \\).
- Transitive: For all \\( x,y,z\in A \\), \\( \ xRy \ \land \ yRz \ \Longleftrightarrow \ xRz \\).

Proof. Reflexive and symmetric properties are obvious, so we will prove the transitive property only. Suppose both \\( xRy \\) and \\( yRz \\), this means that there are subsets \\( X,Y\subseteq A \\) from a partition \\( \mathcal{C} \\) for which \\( x,y\in X \\) and \\( y,z \in Y \\). Notice that \\( y\in X\cap Y \\) so the intersection is nonempty. This necessitates \\( X=Y \\), and \\( xRz \\) is obvious from here. \\( \Box \\)

We now would like to prove the converse, that is, if \\( R\subseteq A\times A \\) is a relation that is reflexive, symmetric, and transitive, then \\( R \\) is an equivalence relation on \\( A \\). How would we prove such a thing? We would need to show that there exists a partition, \\( \mathcal{C} \\) of \\( A \\) such that
