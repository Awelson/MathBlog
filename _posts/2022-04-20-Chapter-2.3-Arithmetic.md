We have already defined numbers but not yet operations such as addition, multiplication, etc.. Recursion is needed for this task, that is why it was important to understand that topic hard as it may be. How should we think of addition in terms of set theory? For example let us say we want to take a number \\( n\in \omega \\) and add it by \\( 3 \\). We can do this by applying the successor operation three times on \\( n \\), i.e, the addition of \\( n \\) and \\( 3 \\) gives:

\\[ \sigma(\sigma(\sigma(n)))=n^{+++} \\] 

Obviously recursion should be involved somehow. If we define a function \\( A_n \\) by recursion of \\( \sigma \\) with seed \\( n \\), then \\( A_n(3)=\sigma^3(n) \\). In general, for any two \\( n,m\in \omega \\) we can define \\( n+m \\) to be equivalent to \\( A_n(m)=\sigma^m(n) \\).

> Theorem 2.3.1 For any \\( n,m\in \omega \\) we have
- \\( n+0=n \\)
- \\( n+m^+=(n+m)^+ \\)

Proof. Remember that \\( A_n \\) has seed \\( n \\) so \\( n+0=A_n(0)=n \\). Next,

\\[ n+m^+=A_n(m^+)=\sigma(A_n(m))=\sigma(n+m). \quad \Box \\]

We now move on to multiplication. We define a function \\( M_n \\) by recursion of \\( A_n \\) with seed \\( 0 \\). For example, 

\\[ M_2(3)=A_2(A_2(A_2(0)))=(2+(2+(2+0))) \\]

which, after a lot of steps, evaluates to \\( 6 \\). In general for any \\( n,m\in \omega \\) we define the multiplication, \\( n\cdot m \\) to be equivalent to \\( M_n(m) \\).

> Theorem 2.3.2 For any \\( n,m\in \omega \\) we have
- \\( n\cdot 0=0 \\)
- \\( n\cdot m^+=n+n\cdot m \\)

Proof. First, \\( n\cdot 0=M_n(0)=0 \\) since \\( M_n \\) has seed \\( 0 \\). Next,

\\[ n\cdot m^+=M_n(m^+)=A_n(M_n(m))=n+M_n(m)=n+n\cdot m. \quad \Box \\]
