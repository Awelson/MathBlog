To be honest, the way we are doing things currently is not 100% rigorous, for instance, I have used sets containing numbers as elements to illustrate some of my points, however, there is no axiom stating that I am allowed to take a number, \\( x \\), put brackets around it, \\( \\{x\\} \\) and be able to call that a set. But, you may say, isn't this the purpose of a set? isn't a set supposed to be a collection of objects? So a collection with a single object, the number \\( x \\), should be considered a set no?

Well, yes you are right, but what we are trying to do by introducing axioms is: we are designing rules by which if an object were to follow these rules, then that object would behave like a basket capable of containing objects. What we do then is we assume that such an object exists and call it a set. Thus a set is defined by the axioms which govern it, we cannot do anything unless an axiom states so.
