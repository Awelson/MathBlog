To be honest, the way we are doing things currently is not 100% rigorous, for instance, I have used sets containing numbers as elements to illustrate some of my points, however, there is no axiom stating that I am allowed to take a number, \\( x \\), put brackets around it, \\( \\{x\\} \\) and be able to call that a set. If we want to be rigorous, we need to follow our axioms, and we need to do so religiously. Of course, I broke this rule a bit to make my explanations clearer. 

Let us start from the beginning then, let us assume that there is no other mathematical knowledge apart from basic logic and the two axioms we have introduced thus far. This makes for a pretty barren landscape, we have only considered sets arbitrarily, but do sets even exist in the first place? We haven't yet introduced an axiom which explicitly states that a set should exist, this is certainly a problem.

If we are going to introduce a set into existence, which set is it going to be? what will it contain? Well, since we currently know not of any other objects, the only set we can will into existence is a set containing nothing. We call such a set an empty set.

> Empty Set Axiom. There is (at least one) set which satisfies \\( \forall x, x\notin A \\).

It is true that \\( x \\) in the above is meant to represent an object, but currently, the only objects capable of existing are sets, so really, any mention of objects or variables refers then to a set for it is the only object capable of existing via our current knowledge. We will see later that it is not necessary to introduce any other type of objects, all of mathematics can be constructed or expressed in terms of sets!

First, let us make sure that there is only one empty set:

> Claim. There is only one set, \\( A \\) satisfying \\( \forall x, x\notin A \\).

Proof. Suppose there are two sets \\( A,B \\) and both satisfy the condition. Assume that \\( A\neq B \\), this means that either \\( A\not\subseteq B \\) or \\( B\not\subseteq A \\). Suppose that \\( A\not\subseteq B \\), this means that there exists an element in \\( A \\) that is not contained in \\( B \\), but since \\( A \\) has no elements, this is not possible. Similarly, \\( B\not\subseteq A \\) is impossible as well, thus, we must have \\( A=B \\). \\( \Box \\)

Since the empty set is unique, we will assign the symbol \\( \empty \\) to represent the empty set. It is easy to notice that for any set \\( A \\), we have \\( \empty \subseteq A \\) since \\( \empty \not\subseteq A \\) is impossible. You might think that this is a pretty uninteresting result considering that the only set currently in existence is \\( \empty \\), this problem will be dealt with shortly.

Instead of introducing more axioms which assert the existence of additional sets, we will introduce axioms which allow us to create additional sets from existing ones, this means that every possible set will be derived from the empty set. We will now introduce the creation axioms:

> Pairing Axiom. For any two sets, \\( A,B \\), there exists a set \\( \mathcal{C} \\) having as members just \\( A \\) and \\( B \\).
\\[ \forall A,B, \ \exists \mathcal{C} \  (x\in \mathcal{C} \ \Longleftrightarrow \ x=A \ \lor \ x=B). \\]
In other words, \\( \mathcal{C}=\\{A,B\\} \\).

> Union Axiom (Preliminary Form). For any two sets, \\( A,B \\), there exists a set \\( C \\) consisting of the members of both \\( A \\) and \\( B \\). Such a set is said to be the union of \\( A \\) and \\( B \\).
\\[ \forall A,B, \ \exists C \ (x\in C \ \Longleftrightarrow \ x\in A \ \lor \ x\in B). \\]

> Power Set Axiom. For any set \\( A \\), there exists a set \\( B \\) whose members are exactly the subsets of \\( A \\). Such a set is said to be the power set of \\( A \\)
\\[ \forall A, \exists B \ (x\in B \ \Longleftrightarrow \ x\subseteq A). \\]

The union of two sets, \\( A,B \\) is given by \\( A\cup B \\) while the power set of a set \\( A \\) is given by \\( \mathcal{P}(A) \\).
