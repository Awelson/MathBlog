To be honest, the way we are doing things currently is not 100% rigorous, for instance, I have used sets containing numbers as elements to illustrate some of my points, however, there is no axiom stating that I am allowed to take a number, \\( x \\), put brackets around it, \\( \\{x\\} \\) and be able to call that a set. But, you may say, isn't this the purpose of a set? isn't a set supposed to be a collection of objects? So a collection with a single object, the number \\( x \\), should be considered a set no?

Well, yes you are right, but what we are trying to do by introducing axioms is: we are designing rules by which if an entity were to follow these rules, then that entity would behave like a basket capable of containing objects.

So, lets start from the very beginning shall we? It would be pretty useless if it turns out that there doesn't exist an entity which is capable of satisfying the axioms we have set up, so let us assume that one exists, that a set exists, an entity which will follow our axioms, what would that set contain? How about nothing! This seems like a wise choice, a set containing nothing is clearly the simplest possible set, and it wouldn't be too far fetched to assume that such a set exists.

> Empty Set Axiom. If a set \\( A \\), satisfies \\( \forall x, x\notin A \\), then \\( A \\) must exist.

It is true that \\( x \\) in the above is meant to represent an object, maybe it is a number, maybe it is a vector, etc... But let us assume that we know not of these objects, assume that all we are given to work with are the axioms, there is nothing else to consider but sets. Any object, any variable, is then a set, for it is the only object capable of existsing via the axioms that we know.

Is it possible to have multiple sets satisfying the condition in the axiom?, it turns out no.

> Claim. There is only one set, \\( A \\) satisfying \\( \forall x, x\notin A \\).

Proof. Suppose there are two sets \\( A,B \\) and both satisfy the condition. We will prove that \\( A=B \\).
