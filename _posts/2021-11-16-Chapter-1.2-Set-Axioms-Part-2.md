To be honest, the way we are doing things currently is not 100% rigorous, for instance, I have used sets containing numbers as elements to illustrate some of my points, however, there is no axiom stating that I am allowed to take a number, \\( x \\), put brackets around it, \\( \\{x\\} \\) and be able to call that a set. If we want to be rigorous, we need to follow our axioms, and we need to do so religiously. Of course, I broke this rule a bit to make my explanations clearer. 

Let us start from the beginning then, let us assume that there is no other mathematical knowledge apart from basic logic and the two axioms we have introduced thus far. This makes for a pretty barren landscape, we have only considered sets arbitrarily, but do sets even exist in the first place? We haven't yet introduced an axiom which explicitly states that a set should exist, this is certainly a problem.

If we are going to introduce a set into existance, which set is it going to be? what will it contain? Well, since we currently know not of any other objects, the only set we can will into existence is a set containing nothing. We call such a set an empty set.

> Empty Set Axiom. There is (at least one) set which satisfies \\( \forall x, x\notin A \\).

It is true that \\( x \\) in the above is meant to represent an object, but currently, the only objects capable of existing are sets, so really, any mention of objects or variables refers then to a set, for it is the only object capable of existing via our current knowledge. We will see later that it is not necessary to introduce any other type of objects, all of mathematics can be constructed or expressed in terms of sets.

Is it possible to have multiple sets satisfying the condition in the axiom?, it turns out no.

> Claim. There is only one set, \\( A \\) satisfying \\( \forall x, x\notin A \\).

Proof. Suppose there are two sets \\( A,B \\) and both satisfy the condition. We will prove that \\( A=B \\).
