We revisit the topic of ordering (see chapter 1.6). What is the right way to construct an ordering on \\( \omega \\)? We already know that

\\[ 0\in 1\in 2\in \cdots \\]

so we can maybe let \\( n<m \\) iff \\( n\in m \\) for any \\( n,m\in \omega \\). Thus the ordering relation will look like

\\[ <=\\{<n,m>\in \omega\times \omega \ \vert \ n\in m\\} \tag{1} \\]

so to determine whether \\( 2<5 \\) we need to check if \\( <2,5>\in < \\), i.e, to check if \\( 2\in 5 \\) which it is because \\( \in \\) is transitive. We can define the symbol \\( \leq \\) to mean

\\[ n\leq m \quad \text{iff} \quad n\in m \ \lor \ n=m. \\]

Really we can dispense the \\( < \\) and \\( \leq \\) notation. Whenever we write \\( n\in m \\) it shall be implicitly understood that \\( n \\) is a number that is less than \\( m \\). Similarly in place of \\( \leq \\) we can use \\( \underbar{\in} \\).

> Theorem 2.4.1 For any \\( p,k\in \omega \\) we have \\( p\in k^+ \\) iff \\( p\underbar{\in} k \\).

Proof. For the -> direction: \\( p\in k^+=\{k\}\cup k \\), so either \\( p\in k \\) or \\( p\in \{k\} -> p=k \\) as needed. The reverse is similar. \\( \Box \\)

Before continuing we should probably show that (1) satisfies the necessary properties to be considered as linear ordering relation.

> Theorem 2.4.2 (1) is a linear ordering relation.

We need to show two things: 1, for any \\( n,m,p\in \omega \\) we have \\( n<m<p \ \rightarrow \ n<p \\). This collapses into \\( n\in m\in p \rightarrow \ n\in p \\). This is true because \\( \in \\) is transitive. 2, trichotomy. This one is harder to prove, we need the following prerequisites:

> Lemma 2.4.3 For any \\( n,m\in \omega \\) we have \\( m\in n \\) iff \\( m^+\in n^+ \\). Also, \\( n\in n \\) is impossible for any \\( n\in \omega \\).
