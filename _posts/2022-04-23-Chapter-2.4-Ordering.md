We revisit the topic of ordering (see chapter 1.6). What is the right way to construct an ordering on \\( \omega \\)? We already know that

\\[ 0\in 1\in 2\in \cdots \\]

so we can maybe let \\( n<m \\) iff \\( n\in m \\) for any \\( n,m\in \omega \\). Thus the ordering relation will look like

\\[ <=\\{<n,m>\in \omega\times \omega \ \vert \ n\in m\\} \tag{1} \\]

so to determine whether \\( 2<5 \\) we need to check if \\( <2,5>\in < \\), i.e, to check if \\( 2\in 5 \\) which it is because \\( \in \\) is transitive. We can define the symbol \\( \leq \\) to mean

\\[ n\leq m \quad \text{iff} \quad n\in m \ \lor \ n=m. \\]

Really we can dispense the \\( < \\) and \\( \leq \\) notation. Whenever we write \\( n\in m \\) it shall be implicitly understood that \\( n \\) is a number that is less than \\( m \\). Similarly in place of \\( \leq \\) we can use \\( \underbar{\in} \\).

> Theorem 2.4.1 For any \\( p,k\in \omega \\) we have \\( p\in k^+ \\) iff \\( p\underbar{\in} k \\).

Proof. For the -> direction: \\( p\in k^+=\{k\}\cup k \\), so either \\( p\in k \\) or \\( p\in \{k\} -> p=k \\) as needed. The reverse is similar. \\( \Box \\)

Before continuing we should probably show that (1) satisfies the necessary properties to be considered as linear ordering relation.

> Theorem 2.4.2 (1) is a linear ordering relation.

We need to show two things: 1, for any \\( n,m,p\in \omega \\) we have \\( n<m<p \ \rightarrow \ n<p \\). This collapses into \\( n\in m\in p \rightarrow \ n\in p \\). This is true because \\( \in \\) is transitive. 2, trichotomy. This one is harder to prove, we need the following prerequisites:

> Lemma 2.4.3 For any \\( n,m\in \omega \\) we have \\( m\in n \\) iff \\( m^+\in n^+ \\). Additionally, \\( n\in n \\) is impossible for any \\( n\in \omega \\).

Proof. We prove \\( m^+\in n^+ \ \rightarrow \ m\in n \\). We have \\( m\in m^+\in \underbar{\in}n \\). If it is the case that \\( m^+\in n \\), then \\( m\in n \\) by transitivity of \\( n \\). If it is the case that \\( m^+=n \\), then \\( m\in n \\) is obvious.

We prove \\( m\in n \ \rightarrow \ m^+\in n^+ \\) by induction. Form the set

\\[ T=\\{ n\in \omega \ \vert \ \forall{m\in n} m^+\in n^+ \\}. \\]

Then \\( 0\in T \\) vacuously. Suppose \\( k\in T \\) and \\( m\in k^+ \\). Then we could have \\( m=k \\), in which case \\( m^+=k^+\in k^{++} \\) so \\( k^+\in T \\). We could also have \\( m\in k \\), in which case, \\( m^+\in k^+ \\) because \\( k\in T \\), and since \\( k^+\in k^{++} \\) we have \\( m^+\in k^{++} \\) by transitivity, so \\( k^+\in T \\) in either case.

Part 2 follows from the claim in the "Induction Explained" section of chapter 2.1. Alternatively we can prove it from part 1 as follows: Let

\\[ T=\\{ n\in \omega \ \vert \ n\notin n \\}. \\]

Then obviously \\( 0\in T \\). Suppose \\( k\in T \\). If \\( k^+\in k^+ \\), then by part 1 we have \\( k\in k \\), this is a contradiction, so we must have \\( k^+\notin k^+ \\), i.e, \\( k^+\in T \\) as needed. \\( \Box \\)
