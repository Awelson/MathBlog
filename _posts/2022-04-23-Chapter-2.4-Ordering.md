We revisit the topic of ordering (see chapter 1.6). What is the right way to construct an ordering on \\( \omega \\)? We already know that

\\[ 0\in 1\in 2\in \cdots \\]

so we can maybe let \\( n<m \\) iff \\( n\in m \\) for any \\( n,m\in \omega \\). Thus the ordering relation will look like

\\[ <=\\{<n,m>\in \omega\times \omega \ \vert \ n\in m\\} \\]

so to determine whether \\( 2<5 \\) we need to check if \\( <2,5>\in < \\), i.e, to check if \\( 2\in 5 \\) which it is because \\( \in \\) is transitive.
