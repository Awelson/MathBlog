A sequence from a set \\( M \\) is a list \\( (x_1,x_2,\ldots) \\), where \\( x_n\in M \\) for each \\( n \\). In writing, we shorten \\( (x_1,x_2,\ldots) \\) into \\( (x_n) \\) and attach (if necessary) \\( \subseteq M \\) infront of a sequence to indicate that it is from the set \\( M \\).

Sometimes, a sequence follows a specific pattern, in other words, we can derive a formula to give the \\( n^{\text{th}} \\) term of a sequence. We attach \\( x_n=\text{formula}(n) \\) infront of a sequence to indicate this pattern. For example: \\( (x_n)\subseteq \mathbb{R}, \ x_n=n^2 \\) denotes the sequence \\( (1,4,9,\ldots) \\). In this case, \\( \subseteq \mathbb{R} \\) is not needed because it is super clear that \\( (x_n) \\) is a sequence of real numbers. 

### Convergence

> Definition 1.3.1 A sequence \\( (x_n)\subseteq M \\) is said to be convergent in the metric space \\( M \\) if there is a point \\( x\in M \\) such that for any \\( \epsilon>0 \\), we can find an \\( N\in \mathbb{N} \\) for which
\\[ d(x_n,x)<\epsilon, \quad \text{for all }n\geq N. \\]
If this is the case, we say that \\( (x_n) \\) converges to \\( x \\) in \\( M \\). We will use the notation \\( \lim{(x_n)}=x \\) or \\( (x_n)\to x \\) to indicate this. If no such \\( x\in M \\) exists, then we say that the sequence is divergent. 

We can express this in terms of a game: A sequence \\( (x_n)\subseteq M \\) converges to a point \\( x \\) in \\( M \\) if and only if Kwan can develop a winning strategy for the following game:

- Sal chooses a positive real number, \\( \epsilon>0 \\).
- In response, Kwan needs to come up with a number, \\( N\in \mathbb{N} \\).
- If \\( d(x_n,x)<\epsilon \\) is true for all \\( n\geq N \\), then Kwan wins, otherwise, Sal wins.

But what does it mean for \\( (x_n) \\) to converge to \\( x \\) anyway? Suppose \\( (x_n)\to x \\) were true, then Kwan can win the game no matter what number Sal chooses in the first move. For example, if Sal chooses the number \\( \epsilon=0.001 \\), Kwan can employ a strategy to find a number \\( N\in \mathbb{N} \\) for which \\( d(x_n,x)<0.001 \\) is true for all \\( n\geq N \\). This statement indicates to us that the points in the sequence from \\( x_N \\) onwards are all really close to the point \\( x \\). The cool thing is, we don't need to stop at \\( \epsilon=0.001 \\), Sal can keep choosing a smaller and smaller value, but Kwan will still win the game anyway. 

Intuitively, the converge of a sequence \\( (x_n) \\) to a point \\( x \\) means that the tail end of \\( (x_n) \\) gets arbitrarily close to the point \\( x \\).

For example, consider the sequence \\( (x_n)\subseteq \mathbb{R}, \ x_n=1/n \\). To say that \\( (x_n)\to 0 \\) is not a dumb guess, so let's verify it! We need a winning strategy for Kwan, lets say Sal chooses a number \\( \epsilon>0 \\), how can Kwan use this information to produce a suitable \\( N \\)? Well, we need

\\[ \|1/n-0\|=1/n<\epsilon, \quad \text{for all }n\geq N. \\]

This is equivalent to needing \\( n>1/\epsilon \\) for all \\( n\geq N \\), and this can be achieved as long as \\( N>1/\epsilon \\). This will be our winning strategy: if Sal chooses a number \\( \epsilon>0 \\), then all Kwan needs to do is to pick a natural number that is larger than \\( 1/\epsilon \\). For example, if Sal chooses \\( \epsilon=0.1 \\), Kwan can pick the number 11, and it is easy to verify that 1/11, 1/12, ... are all within a 0.1 distance of the point 0.

### Caution!

When talking about convergence, it is important to specify the metric space in which a sequence converges in. For example, the sequence \\( (x_n), \ x_n=1/n \\) converges to \\( 0 \\) in \\( \mathbb{R} \\) if it is paired with the euclidean 1-metric, however, the same is not true if we pair \\( \mathbb{R} \\) with the discrete metric. If \\( d \\) is the discrete metric, then Kwan does not have a guaranteed victory, for example, if Sal chooses \\( \epsilon=1 \\), then Kwan needs to choose an \\( N \\) that satisfies

\\[ d(x_n,0)<\epsilon=1, \quad \text{for all }n\geq N \\]

However, since \\( d(x_n,0)=1 \\) for all \\( n \\), the above is same as saying

\\[ 1<1, \quad \text{for all }n\geq N \\]

Regardless of whatever \\( N \\) Kwan comes up with, the above is false, so Sal wins. The point is: simply stating that \\( (x_n)\to x \\) is ambiguous, because, while it may be clear which set the sequence \\( (x_n) \\) is from, it may not be clear which metric on \\( M \\) we are currently using, as we just have shown, different metrics leads to different convergence properties. We will not be so detailed as to specify everything in writing, the reader is expected to fill in these gaps themselves.

### Some Theorems

> Theorem 1.3.2 Let \\( M \\) be a metric space, and suppose we have a sequence \\( (x_n)\subseteq M \\). If \\( x,y\in M \\) are distinct points, then having both \\( (x_n)\to x \\) and \\( (x_n)\to y \\) is impossible.

Proof. Let us assume that both \\( (x_n)\to x \\) and \\( (x_n)\to y \\) are true. This means that if Sal chooses \\( \epsilon=d(x,y)/2 \\) (Note. \\( 0<d(x,y) \\) because Theorem 1.2.1), Kwan is able to come up with the numbers \\( N_1,N_2 \\) which satisfy \\( d(x_n,x)<\epsilon \\) for all \\( n\geq N_1 \\) and \\( d(x_n,y)<\epsilon \\) for all \\( n\geq N_2 \\). Thus, if \\( N=\text{max}\\{N_1,N_2\\} \\), then it must be that \\( d(x_N,x)<\epsilon \\) and \\( d(x_N,y)<\epsilon \\). By triangle inequality,

\\[ d(x,y)\leq d(x,x_N)+d(x_N,y)<2\epsilon=d(x,y) \quad \Longrightarrow \quad d(x,y)<d(x,y) \\]

but this is a contradiction. \\( \Box \\)

- This tells us that the limit of a sequence is unique.

> Theorem 1.3.3 Let \\( M \\) be a metric space, suppose we have two convergent sequences \\( (x_n)\to x \\) and \\( (y_n)\to y \\), then the sequence \\( (z_n)\subseteq \mathbb{R}, \ z_n=d(x_n,y_n) \\) converges to \\( d(x,y) \\).

Proof. Say Sal chooses an \\( \epsilon>0 \\), Kwan needs to come up with a response, here's how: If given the number \\( \epsilon/2 \\), Kwan has a strategy to come up with the numbers \\( N_1,N_2 \\), satisfying \\( d(x_n,x)<\epsilon/2 \\) for all \\( n\geq N_1 \\) and \\( d(y_n,y)<\epsilon/2 \\) for all \\( n\geq N_2 \\) respectively. Thus, if \\( N=\text{max}\\{N_1,N_2\\} \\), it must be that \\( d(x_N,x)<\epsilon/2 \\) and \\( d(y_N,y)<\epsilon/2 \\) for all \\( n\geq N \\). By triangle inequality, the following is true for all \\( n\geq N \\):

\\[ \begin{align\*} d(x_n,y_n)&\leq d(x_n,x)+d(x,y)+d(y_n,y)<d(x,y)+\epsilon, \newline
d(x,y)&\leq d(x,x_n)+d(x_n,y_n)+d(y_n,y)<d(x_n,y_n)+\epsilon. \end{align\*} \\]

Together, this means that \\( \|z_n-d(x,y)\|<\epsilon \\) for all \\( n\geq N \\). Thus, all Kwan needs to do is to respond to Sal's chosen \\( \epsilon \\) with maximum between \\( N_1,N_2 \\). \\( \Box \\)

You may find it strange that Kwan is able to respond with the numbers \\( N_1,N_2 \\) when given \\( \epsilon/2 \\). But this is not strange at all, after all, Kwan is able to respond to any chosen \\( \epsilon>0 \\) by Sal,

and it makes no difference if Sal were to input his chosen \\( \epsilon \\) into a machine which divides numbers by 2, and then afterwards, give the results to Kwan.

Remember, Kwan is able to respond to any positive real number, and \\( \epsilon/2 \\) is indeed a positive real number. In fact, any manipulation to \\( \epsilon \\) is allowed, as long as the result is still a positive real number.

### Tasks

- Let \\( (x_n) \\) be a sequence, for \\( m\in \mathbb{N} \\), we write \\( (x_n)_m^\infty \\) to mean the sequence \\( (x_m,x_{m+1},\ldots) \\). Prove that for any \\( m\in \mathbb{N} \\), both \\( (x_n)_m^\infty \\) and \\( (x_n) \\) converge to the same point [supposing either one of (x_n)_m^\infty and (x_n) converges].
