A sequence from a set \\( M \\) is a list \\( (x_1,x_2,\ldots) \\), where \\( x_n\in M \\) for each \\( n \\). In writing, we shorten \\( (x_1,x_2,\ldots) \\) into \\( (x_n) \\) and attach (if necessary) \\( \subseteq M \\) infront of a sequence to indicate that it is from the set \\( M \\).

Sometimes, a sequence follows a specific pattern, in other words, we can derive a formula to give the \\( n^{\text{th}} \\) term of a sequence. We attach \\( x_n=\text{formula}(n) \\) infront of a sequence to indicate this pattern. For example: \\( (x_n)\subseteq \mathbb{R}, \ x_n=n \\) denotes the sequence \\( (1,2,3,\ldots) \\).  

### Convergence

> Definition. A sequence \\( (x_n)\subseteq M \\) is said to converge in the metric space \\( M \\) if there is a point \\( x\in M \\) such that for any \\( \epsilon>0 \\), we can find an \\( N\in \mathbb{N} \\) for which
\\[ d(x_n,x)<\epsilon, \quad \text{for all }n\geq N. \\]
If no such \\( x\in M \\) exists, then we say that the sequence is divergent. 

That is a mouthfull, so we will express this in terms of a game: A sequence \\( (x_n)\subseteq M \\) converges in \\( M \\) if Kwan can develop a winning strategy for the following game:

- Kwan needs to select a point, \\( x\in M \\).
- Sal can reply back with any positive real number, \\( \epsilon>0 \\).
- In response, Kwan needs to come up with a number, \\( N\in \mathbb{N} \\).
- If \\( d(x_n,x)<\epsilon \\) is true for all \\( n\geq N \\), then Kwan wins, otherwise, Sal wins.
