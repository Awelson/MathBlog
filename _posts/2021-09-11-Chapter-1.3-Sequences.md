A sequence from a set \\( M \\) is a list \\( (x_1,x_2,\ldots) \\), where \\( x_n\in M \\) for each \\( n \\). In writing, we shorten \\( (x_1,x_2,\ldots) \\) into \\( (x_n) \\) and attach (if necessary) \\( \subseteq M \\) infront of a sequence to indicate that it is from the set \\( M \\).

Sometimes, a sequence follows a specific pattern, in other words, we can derive a formula to give the \\( n^{\text{th}} \\) term of a sequence. We attach \\( x_n=\text{formula}(n) \\) infront of a sequence to indicate the pattern which it follows. For example: \\( (x_n)\subseteq \mathbb{R}, x_n=n \\) denotes the sequence \\( (1,2,3,\ldots) \\).
