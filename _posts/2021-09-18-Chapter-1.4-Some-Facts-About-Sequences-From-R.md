Any mention of a sequence from this point onwards will automatically be regarded as a sequence from \\( \mathbb{R} \\) (unless otherwise specified), and the metric we will employ, of course, shall be the euclidean 1-metric. Here is a preliminary definition before we get started:

> Definition 1.4.1 We say that a sequence (from \\( \mathbb{R} \\)) is bounded above if it's range is bounded above, similarly, it is said to be bounded below if its range is bounded below.

Thus, a sequence \\( (x_n) \\) is bounded above if there exists an \\( a\in \mathbb{R} \\) such that \\( x_n\leq a  \\) for all \\( n \\), similarly, \\( (x_n) \\) is bounded below if there exists a \\( b\in \mathbb{R} \\) such that \\( b\leq x_n \\) for all \\( n \\).

> Theorem 1.4.2 Let \\( A \\) be a nonempty subset of \\( \mathbb{R} \\) that is bounded above, then a sequence, \\( (x_n)\subseteq A \\).
