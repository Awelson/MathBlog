Any mention of a sequence from this point onwards will automatically be regarded as a sequence from \\( \mathbb{R} \\) (unless otherwise specified), and the metric we will employ, of course, shall be the euclidean 1-metric. Here is a preliminary definition before we get started:

> Definition 1.4.1 We say that a sequence (from \\( \mathbb{R} \\)) is bounded above if it's range is bounded above, similarly, it is said to be bounded below if its range is bounded below.

Thus, a sequence \\( (x_n) \\) is bounded above if there exists an \\( a\in \mathbb{R} \\) such that \\( x_n\leq a  \\) for all \\( n \\), similarly, \\( (x_n) \\) is bounded below if there exists a \\( b\in \mathbb{R} \\) such that \\( b\leq x_n \\) for all \\( n \\).

> Theorem 1.4.2 Let \\( A \\) be a nonempty subset of \\( \mathbb{R} \\) that is bounded above. There is a sequence \\( (x_n)\subseteq A \\) that converges to \\( \text{sup }A \\).

Proof. Let \\( x=\text{sup }A \\), if \\( x\in A \\), then we are done because \\( (x,x,\ldots)\subseteq A \\) and \\( (x,x,\ldots)\to x \\) as needed. Now let us suppose \\( x\notin A \\), Kwan will construct a sequence as follows: Given an \\( n\in \mathbb{N} \\), Kwan notices that \\( x-\frac{1}{n} \\) is not an upper bound of \\( A \\), thus there has to exist some number, \\( a_n\in A \\), such that \\( x-\frac{1}{n}<a_n \\). Kwan presents the sequence \\( (a_n) \\) as proof. What's left to do is to confirm whether or not \\( (a_n)\to x \\) as needed.

To this end, Sal chooses an \\( \epsilon>0 \\), Kwan's strategy is to reply with an \\( N\geq \frac{1}{\epsilon} \\). Check for yourself that

\\[ x-\epsilon<x-\frac{1}{n}<a_n, \quad \text{for all }n\geq N. \\]

With a bit more work, we obtain \\( x-a_n=\|x-a_n\|<\epsilon \\) for all \\( n\geq N \\). Thus, \\( (a_n)\to x \\) as desired. \\( \Box \\)
