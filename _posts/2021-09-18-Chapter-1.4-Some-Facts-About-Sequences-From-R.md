Any mention of a sequence from this point onwards will automatically be regarded as a sequence from \\( \mathbb{R} \\), and the metric we will employ, of course, shall be the euclidean 1-metric

> Definition 1.4.1 We say that a sequence (from \\( \mathbb{R} \\)) is bounded above if it's range is bounded above, similarly, it is said to be bounded below if its range is bounded below.

Thus, we see that \\( (x_n) \\) is bounded above if there exists an \\( a\in \mathbb{R} \\) such that \\( x_n\leq a  \\) for all \\( n \\), similarly, \\( (x_n) \\) is bounded below if there exists a \\( b\in \mathbb{R} \\) such that \\( b\leq x_n \\) for all \\( n \\).
