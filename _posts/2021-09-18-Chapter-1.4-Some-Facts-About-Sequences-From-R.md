Any mention of a sequence from this point onwards will automatically be regarded as a sequence from \\( \mathbb{R} \\) (unless otherwise specified), and the metric we will employ, of course, shall be the euclidean 1-metric. Here is a preliminary definition before we get started:

> Definition 1.4.1 We say that a sequence (from \\( \mathbb{R} \\)) is bounded above if it's range is bounded above, similarly, it is said to be bounded below if its range is bounded below.

Thus, a sequence \\( (x_n) \\) is bounded above if there exists an \\( a\in \mathbb{R} \\) such that \\( x_n\leq a  \\) for all \\( n \\), similarly, \\( (x_n) \\) is bounded below if there exists a \\( b\in \mathbb{R} \\) such that \\( b\leq x_n \\) for all \\( n \\).

> Theorem 1.4.2 Let \\( A \\) be a nonempty subset of \\( \mathbb{R} \\) that is bounded above. There is a sequence \\( (x_n)\subseteq A \\) that converges to \\( \text{sup }A \\).

Proof. Let \\( x=\text{sup }A \\), if \\( x\in A \\), then we are done because \\( (x,x,\ldots)\subseteq A \\) and \\( (x,x,\ldots)\to x \\) as needed. Now let us suppose \\( x\notin A \\). Kwan will construct a sequence as follows: Given an \\( n\in \mathbb{N} \\), he notices that \\( x-\frac{1}{n} \\) is not an upper bound of \\( A \\), thus there has to exist some number, \\( a_n\in A \\), such that \\( x-\frac{1}{n}<a_n \\). Kwan presents the sequence \\( (a_n) \\) as proof, what's left to do is to confirm whether or not \\( (a_n)\to x \\) as needed.

To this end, Sal chooses an \\( \epsilon>0 \\), Kwan's strategy is to reply with an \\( N\geq \frac{1}{\epsilon} \\). Check for yourself that

\\[ x-\epsilon<x-\frac{1}{n}<a_n, \quad \text{for all }n\geq N. \\]

With a bit more work, we obtain \\( x-a_n=\|x-a_n\|<\epsilon \\) for all \\( n\geq N \\). Thus, \\( (a_n)\to x \\) as desired. \\( \Box \\)

Notice that the sequence Kwan presented as proof does not contain \\( x \\) whatsoever, i.e, \\( a_n\neq x \\) for all \\( n \\) [this is because \\( x\notin A \\)]. This is not important right now, but will be at some later point. Also note that there is, of course, a corresponding theorem for when \\( A \\) is bounded below instead.

> Theorem 1.4.3 Let \\( (a_n) \\) and \\( (b_n) \\) be two convergent sequences such that there exists an \\( N \\) for which \\( a_n\leq b_n \\) for all \\( n\geq N \\). Then \\( \lim{(a_n)}\leq \lim{(b_n)} \\) is true.

Proof. Write \\( a=\lim{(a_n)} \\) and \\( b=\lim{(b_n)} \\). We prove by contradiction, so suppose \\( a>b \\). If Sal were to chose \\( \epsilon=\frac{a-b}{2} \\), then Kwan can find a number \\( N_1 \\) such that \\( \|a_n-a\|<\epsilon (\to a-\epsilon<a_n) \\) for all \\( n\geq N_1 \\) and also a number \\( N_2 \\) such that \\( \|b_n-b\|<\epsilon (\to b_n<b+\epsilon) \\) for all \\( n\geq N_2 \\). Thus, if \\( N_3=\text{max}\\{N_1,N_2,N\\} \\), we will have

\\[ a-\epsilon<a_{N_3}\leq b_{N_3}<b+\epsilon. \\]

This implies that \\( a<b+2\epsilon=a \\) which is a contradiction. \\( \Box \\)

> Corollary 1.4.3.1 Let \\( a,b\in \mathbb{R} \\). Suppose that for any \\( \epsilon>0 \\) we have \\( a<b+\epsilon \\), then it must be that \\( a\leq b \\).

Proof. If for any \\( \epsilon>0 \\) we have \\( a\leq b+\epsilon \\), then we must have \\( a\leq b+\frac{1}{n} \\) for all \\( n \\). Let \\( (a_n)=(a,a,\ldots) \\) and \\( (b_n), \ b_n=b+\frac{1}{n} \\) in Theorem 1.4.3, then after proving that \\( \lim{(b_n)}=b \\) (do this one yourself), we will obtain \\( a\leq b \\) as desired. \\( \Box \\)

> Corollary 1.4.3.2 [Squeeze Theorem] Let \\( (a_n),(b_n),(c_n) \\) be three sequences. If there exists an \\( N \\) for which \\( a_n\leq c_n\leq b_n \\) for all \\( n\geq N \\) and \\( \lim{(a_n)}=\lim{(b_n)} \\) (supposing \\( (a_n),(b_n) \\) are convergent), then \\( \lim{(c_n)}=\lim{(a_n)}=\lim{(b_n)} \\).

Proof. We know that \\( \lim{(a_n)}\leq \lim{(c_n)} \\) and \\( \lim{(c_n)}\leq \lim{(b_n)} \\) by Theorem 1.4.3, combining, we obtain

\\[ \lim{(a_n)}\leq \lim{(c_n)}\leq \lim{(b_n)} \\]

If \\( \lim{(a_n)} \\) and \\( \lim{(b_n)} \\) are the same number, say, \\( x \\), then obviously \\( x=\lim{(c_n)} \\).
