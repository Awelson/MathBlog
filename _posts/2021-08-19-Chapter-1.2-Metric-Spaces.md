We will now discuss metric spaces. The word 'metric' is another way to say distance, so we may think of a metric space as a set of points with a notion of distance. What we mean by a notion of distance boils down to the existence of a function that defines a distance between any two points of the set in terms of a real number. Henceforth, we come up with the following definition:

> Definition 1.2.1 A metric space is the pair \\( (M,d) \\), where \\( M \\) is a set and \\( d:M\times M\to \mathbb{R} \\) is a function that takes in any two points of \\( M \\) and outputs a real number, since this number is meant to represent the distance between those two points, it is pertient that \\( d \\) should satisfy the following rules:
- \\( d(x,x)=0, \quad \\) for any \\( x\in M. \\)
- \\( d(x,y)=d(y,x), \quad \\) for any \\( x,y\in M. \\)
- \\( d(x,z)\leq d(x,y)+d(y,z), \quad \\) for any \\( x,y,z,\in M. \\)

If a function satisfies these rules, it is said to be a metric on \\( M \\).

**Example.** The set \\( \mathbb{R} \\) along with the function \\( d:\mathbb{R}^2\to \mathbb{R} \\) defined by \\( d(x,y)=\|x-y\| \\) forms a metric space. Notice that \\( d \\) represents our standard/familiar way of calculating the distance between any two real numbers. We will now verify whether the way we have been doing things constitutes a valid metric on \\( \mathbb{R} \\).

> Claim. \\( d \\) is a metric on \\( \mathbb{R} \\).

Proof. It is easy to show that \\( d \\) satsifies the first two rules. For the third rule, we need to prove that

\\[ \|x-z\|\leq \|x-y\|+\|y-z\|, \quad \text{for any }x,y,z\in M. \\]

Let us first prove the simpler, \\( \|a+b\|\leq \|a\|+\|b\|, \ a,b\in \mathbb{R}. \\) Notice that

\\[ \begin{align\*} -\|a\|&\leq a\leq \|a\| \newline -\|b\|&\leq b\leq \|b\| \end{align*} \\]

Adding gives

\\[ -(\|a\|+\|b\|)\leq a+b\leq \|a\|+\|b\| \quad \Longleftrightarrow \quad \|a+b\|\leq \|a\|+\|b\|. \\]

Now, make the substitution \\( a=x-y \\) and \\( b=y-z \\), this completes the proof. \\( \Box \\)
