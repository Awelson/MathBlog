> Definition 1.2.1 A metric space is a couple \\( (M,d) \\), where \\( M \\) is a set and \\( d:M\times M\to \mathbb{R} \\) is a function that takes in any two points of \\( M \\) and outputs a real number, idealy, we want this number to represent the distance between those two points, as such, \\( d \\) should satisfy the following rules,
- \\( d(x,x)=0, \quad \\) for any \\( x\in M. \\)
- \\( d(x,y)=d(y,x) \quad \\) for any \\( x,y\in M. \\)
- \\( d(x,z)\leq d(x,y)+d(y,z) \\) for any \\( x,y,z,\in M. \\)
