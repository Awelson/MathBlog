We will now discuss metric spaces. The word 'metric' is another way to say distance, so we may think of a metric space as a set of points with a notion of distance. What we mean by a notion of distance boils down to the existence of a function that defines a distance between any two points of the set in terms of a real number. Henceforth, we come up with the following definition:

> Definition 1.2.1 A metric space is a pair \\( (M,d) \\), where \\( M \\) is a set and \\( d:M\times M\to \mathbb{R} \\) is a function that takes in any two points of \\( M \\) and outputs a real number, since this number is meant to represent the distance between those two points, it is pertient that \\( d \\) should satisfy the following rules:
- \\( d(x,x)=0, \ \\) for any \\( x\in M. \\) 
- If \\( x,y\in M \\) and \\( d(x,y)=0 \\), then it must be that \\( x=y \\).
- \\( d(x,y)=d(y,x), \ \\) for any \\( x,y\in M. \\)
- \\( d(x,z)\leq d(x,y)+d(y,z), \ \\) for any \\( x,y,z,\in M. \\) 

If a function satisfies these rules, it is said to be a metric on \\( M \\). The third rule in particular is important, it is known as the triangle inequality.

**Example.** The set \\( \mathbb{R} \\) along with the function \\( d:\mathbb{R}^2\to \mathbb{R} \\) defined by \\( d(x,y)=\|x-y\|, \ x,y\in \mathbb{R} \\) defines a metric space. Notice that \\( d \\) represents our standard/familiar way of calculating the distance between any two real numbers. We will now verify whether or not the way we have been doing things constitutes a valid metric on \\( \mathbb{R} \\).

> Claim 1. \\( d \\) is a metric on \\( \mathbb{R} \\).

Proof. It is easy to show that \\( d \\) satsifies the first three rules, hence we will prove the triangle inequality only, i.e, we need to show that

\\[ \|x-z\|\leq \|x-y\|+\|y-z\|, \quad \text{for any }x,y,z\in M. \\]

Let us first prove the simpler, \\( \|a+b\|\leq \|a\|+\|b\|, \ a,b\in \mathbb{R}. \\) Notice that

\\[ \begin{align\*} -\|a\|&\leq a\leq \|a\| \newline -\|b\|&\leq b\leq \|b\| \end{align*} \\]

Adding gives

\\[ -(\|a\|+\|b\|)\leq a+b\leq \|a\|+\|b\| \quad \Longleftrightarrow \quad \|a+b\|\leq \|a\|+\|b\|. \\]

Now, make the substitution \\( a=x-y \\) and \\( b=y-z \\), this completes the proof. \\( \Box \\)

**Example.** Consider \\( \mathbb{R}^2 \\), we are also familiar with a method of measuring distances between points from this set. This method (metric) is derived from Pythagoras' theorem, \\( d:\mathbb{R}^2\times \mathbb{R}^2\to \mathbb{R} \\), where if \\( x=(x_1,x_2) \\) and \\( y=(y_1,y_2) \\) are arbitrary points of \\( \mathbb{R}^2 \\), then \\( d(x,y)=\sqrt{\|x_1-x_2\|^2+\|y_1-y_2\|^2} \\).

- Derive a 'familiar' metric for \\( \mathbb{R}^3 \\), generalize this to \\( \mathbb{R}^n \\)
- This 'familiar' metric for measuring distances between points of \\( \mathbb{R}^n \\) is known as the Euclidean \\(n\\)-metric. Unless otherwise specified, whenever we use/mention \\( \mathbb{R}^n \\) as a metric space, it is to be assumed that we are using the euclidean \\(n\\)-metric.
- We will prove that the euclidean \\(n\\)-metric satisfies the triangle inequality in a future post. For now, we will just have to be satisfied with knowing that this is true for \\( n=1 \\) (Claim 1). 

It is important to realize that it is possible for the same set to be paired up with distinct metrics. In other words, there could potentially be more than one notion of distance applied to the same set. For example, \\( d_1 \\) and \\( d_2 \\) could be two distinct metrics on \\( M \\), after pairing we obtain the different metric spaces \\( (M,d_1) \\) and \\( (M,d_2) \\), the same set of points, but a different method of measuring the distances between those points. A concrete example is given later on.

**Example.** We will provide a metric that can be paired with any arbitrary set. Let \\( M \\) be an arbitrary set, then the function defined by

\\[ d(x,y)=\begin{cases} 0 &\text{ if }x=y \newline 1 &\text{ if }x\neq y \end{cases}, \quad x,y\in M. \\]

constitutes as a metric on \\( M \\). It is known as the discrete metric. Here is a proof:

We will prove the triangle inequality only, i.e, we need to show that

\\[ d(x,z)\leq d(x,y)+d(y,z), \quad x,y,z\in M. \\]

We shall split into two cases. First assume that \\( x\neq y \\), so we need to prove that

\\[ d(x,z)\leq 1+d(y,z). \\]

This is inequality is obviously true since both \\( d(x,z) \\) and \\( d(y,z) \\) can only be either \\( 0 \\) or \\( 1 \\). Next, we assume that \\( x=y \\), this means we need to prove that

\\[ d(x,z)\leq d(y,z). \\]

The only way for this inequality to be false is if \\( d(x,z)=1 \\) and \\( d(y,z)=0 \\). This implies that \\( x\neq z \\) and \\( y=z \\), but the latter is impossible given that \\( x=y \\). \\( \Box \\)

This means that any arbitrary set can be turned into a metric space, we just need to pair it with the discrete metric. 

**Example.** Let \\( d_1 \\) denote the euclidean 1-metric and \\( d_2 \\) denote the discrete metric. Either of these can be paired with \\( \mathbb{R} \\) to form a metric space, for example, pairing \\(d_1\\) with \\( \mathbb{R} \\) gives \\( (\mathbb{R},d_1) \\), and pairing it with \\( d_2 \\) gives \\( (\mathbb{R},d_2) \\). For example, the distance between 5 and 3 in the first metric space is 2, while in the second metric space it is 1.

> When we write something along the lines of "Let \\( (M,d) \\) be a metric space", we mean that \\( M \\) is an arbitrary set and \\( d \\) is an arbitrary metric on \\( M \\). However, to simplify things, we shall write "Let \\( M \\) be a metric space" instead. Here, a metric is not explicitly mentioned, but we expect the reader to have a tacit understanding that some arbitrary metric \\( d \\) is available upon demand. This may lead to confusion because \\( M \\) may either be referring to a metric space, or a set. I.e, \\( M=(M,d) \\) depending on context and the situation, we ask that the reader keep this in mind.

### Basic Theorems on Metric Spaces

> Theorem 1.2.1 If \\( M \\) is a metric space and \\( x,y\in M \\) are two distinct points, then \\( d(x,y)>0 \\).

Proof. We know \\( d(x,y) \\) cannot be equal to zero because that would imply \\( x=y \\) (rule 1), so now we only need to disprove \\( d(x,y)<0 \\). By the triangle inequality,

\\[ 0=d(x,x)\leq d(x,y)+d(y,x)=2d(x,y) \ , \\]

Therefore, it is impossible for \\( d(x,y)<0 \\). \\( \Box \\)

> Theorem 1.2.2 [Reverse Triangle Inequality] If \\( M \\) is a metric space, then 
\\[ \|d(x,z)-d(y,z)\|\leq d(x,y), \quad x,y,z\in M. \\]

Proof. By triangle inequality, 

\\[ d(x,z)\leq d(x,y)+d(y,z) \quad \Longrightarrow \quad d(x,z)-d(y,z)\leq d(x,y). \\]

Similarly,

\\[ d(y,z)\leq d(y,x)+d(x,z) \quad \Longrightarrow \quad -d(x,y)\leq d(x,z)-d(x,y). \\]

Therefore,

\\[ -d(x,y)\leq d(x,z)-d(x,y)\leq d(x,y) \quad \Longrightarrow \quad \|d(x,z)-d(x,y)\|\leq d(x,y). \quad \Box \\]

### Metric Subspaces

Given a metric space \\( (M,d) \\), any subset \\( S \\) of \\( M \\) can be turned into a metric space in its own right, this is done by pairing \\( S \\) with the restriction \\( p=d\|_{S\times S} \\). In other words, we shall choose to measure distances between points of \\( S \\) the same way we would as if they were points in \\( (M,d) \\). The diagram below highlights the idea:

![Capture.PNG](/MathBlog/assets/Capture3.PNG)

It is obvious that \\( p \\) is a metric on \\( S \\), the (four) properties satisfied by \\( d \\) simply carries over to its restriction, \\( p \\). Our point is: a metric on \\( M \\) automatically defines a metric on a subset \\( S\subseteq M \\) via restriction, such a metric is said to be one that is 'inherited' from \\( M \\). Pairing any subset of \\( M \\) with an inherited metric creates what is known as a metric subspace of \\( (M,d) \\). This leads to the following definition:

> Definition 1.2.3 Let \\( (M,d) \\) be a metric space and let \\( S \\) be a subset of \\( M \\). We define a metric \\( p \\) on \\( S \\) by \\( p(x,y)=d(x,y), \ \forall x,y\in S \\). Then, \\( (S,p) \\) is a metric space, more specifically it is said to be a metric subspace of \\( (M,d) \\).

**Example.** Let \\( \mathbb{N} \\) be a metric subspace of \\( \mathbb{R} \\), what do we mean by that? We are referring specifically to the pairing between \\( \mathbb{N} \\) and an inherited metric from \\( \mathbb{R} \\). If we want to be more specific, this inherited metric is the restriction \\(p= d\|_{\mathbb{N}\times \mathbb{N}} \\), where \\( d \\) is the euclidean 1-metric.

> In line with the example above, whenever we state something along the lines of 'Let \\( S \\) be a metric subspace of \\( M \\)', a metric on \\( S \\) is not explicitly mentioned, this is because the reader is expected to have an automatic understanding that the metric on \\( S \\) has to be one that is inherited from \\( M \\). 

> We will often use the symbol/name for the distance function on a subspace as is used for the distance function on the containing space (the metric space that contains the subspace), this is to avoid a notational mess.

### The Diameter of a Metric Space

The diameter of a metric space is the largest possible distance between any two points, it gives us an idea of how big a metric space is. The diameter is defined as follows:

> Definition 1.2.4 The diameter of a metric space \\( M \\) is given by
\\[ \text{diam}(M)=\text{sup }\\{d(x,y) \ \vert \ x,y\in M\\}. \\]

If we would like to obtain the diameter of only a particular section of a metric space \\( M \\) (for example, instead of asking what the diameter of \\( \mathbb{R} \\) is, we ask what the diameter of \\( \\{2,4,7\\} \\) is instead), we may simply take the diameter of the metric subspace of \\( M \\) which corresponds to that particular section.

**Example.** The diameter of the metric subspace \\( (0,1) \\) of \\( \mathbb{R} \\) is 

\\[ \text{sup }\\{\|x-y\| \ \vert \ x,y\in (0,1)\\}=1. \\]

To prove this, let us first show that 1 is an upper bound for this set: Let \\( x,y\in (0,1) \\) be arbitrary. Verify that \\( d(x,0.5)\leq 0.5 \\), where \\( d \\) is the euclidean 1-metric. Now the triangle inequality gives

\\[ \|x-y\|=d(x,y)\leq d(x,0.5)+d(0.5,y)\leq 1. \\]

- Why don't we need to prove that \\( d(y,0.5)\leq 0.5 \\) as well?

so we are done. Now let us show that if \\( c<1 \\), then \\( c \\) cannot be an upper bound for the set. We may assume that \\( 0<c<1 \\) and ignore the other cases (why?). Now we need to show that there exists \\( x,y\in (0,1) \\) such that \\( c<d(x,y) \\). Verify that there exists an \\( \epsilon>0 \\) such that \\( c+\epsilon<1 \\). . Now see that

\\[ c<d(c+\epsilon,\epsilon/2)=c+\epsilon/2. \\]

- Why should it be that \\( \epsilon/2\in (0,1) \\)?

- What is the diamater of the metric subspace \\( [0,1] \\) of \\( \mathbb{R} \\)? Don't worry, this one is easier.

> Definition 1.2.5 A metric space is said to be bounded if its diameter is finite, otherwise we say it is unbounded.

- An example of an unbounded metric space is the metric subspace \\( \mathbb{N} \\) of \\( \mathbb{R} \\), verify this claim.
- In chapter 1.1, we provided an alternative description of boundedness for subsets of \\( \mathbb{R} \\) (Definition 1.1.6). Show that the two descriptions are equivalent, i.e, that a subset \\( A \\) of \\( \mathbb{R} \\) is bounded (according to definition 1.1.6) if and only if the metric subspace \\( A\subseteq \mathbb{R} \\) has finite diameter.

> Let \\( M \\) be a metric space, to show that \\( M \\) is bounded, we don't actually need to know the value of \\( \text{diam}(M)=\text{sup }A \\) \\( (A=\\{d(x,y) \ \vert \ x,y\in M\\}) \\)). By the least upper bound property, it suffices to show that \\( A \\) is bounded above, this implies that \\( \text{sup }A \\) exists (and is therefore finite).

> Theorem 1.2.6 Let \\( M \\) be a metric space and suppose that \\( M=A\cup B \\), where \\( A,B \\) are subsets of \\( M \\). If \\( A,B \\) both have finite diameter, then so does \\( M \\).

Proof. Let \\( \text{diam}(A)=\alpha \\) and \\( \text{diam}(B)=\beta \\). We need to show that there exists a real number \\( r \\) for which \\( d(m_1,m_2)\leq r \\) for all \\( m_1,m_2\in M \\). Let us turn this into a game:

1. Sal picks a real number, \\( r \\).
2. Kwan can then pick any two points, \\( m_1,m_2\in M \\).
3. If \\( d(m_1,m_2)\leq r \\) then Sal wins, otherwise, Kwan wins.

Now we need to develop a strategy that guarantees Sal's victory no matter how many times Kwan demands a rematch. Here is the strategy: Sal will choose some point \\( a\in A \\) and some point \\( b\in B \\) of his own volition, and then notice that by triangle inequality

\\[ d(m_1,m_2)\leq d(m_1,a)+d(a,b)+d(b,m_2)\leq \alpha+\beta+d(a,b), \quad \forall m_1\in A, \forall m_2\in B. \tag{1} \\]

With this information, Sal is confident in picking \\( r=\alpha+\beta+d(a,b) \\), the game can then continue in one of three ways: 1) Kwan chooses one point from \\( A \\) and another from \\( B \\), 2) Kwan chooses both points from \\( A \\), 3) Kwan chooses both points from \\( B \\). 

In the first scenario, Kwan loses because of (1). In the second scenario, Kwan loses because the distance between the points \\( \leq\alpha<r \\). For similar reasons, Kwan also loses in the third scenario. There is nothing Kwan can do to win. \\( \Box \\) 

- If \\( A\cap B \\) is non-empty, then Sal can choose \\( a\in A \\) and \\( b\in B \\) so that \\( a=b \\). This means that \\( \text{diam}(M)\leq \alpha+\beta \\) if \\( A\cap B \\) is not disjoint.
- By induction, if \\( M=\bigcup_{n=1}^k{U_n} \\), \\( \ k \\) is finite, and each \\( U_n \\) has finite diameter, then \\( M \\) also has finite diameter.

***

- Show that if a metric space \\( M \\) is bounded then every metric subspace of \\( M \\) is also bounded
- Let \\( M \\) be a metric space and \\( S\subseteq M \\) be a metric subspace. Show that if \\( S \\) is unbounded, then so is \\( M \\). Hint: use the above, and then proof by contradiction

### Distance between Sets and Points

> Definition. Let \\( M \\) be a metric space and \\( S\subseteq M \\), then we define the distance between a point \\( x\in M \\) and the set \\( S \\) as \\( d(x,S)=\text{inf}\{d(x,s) \ \vert \ s\in S\} \\), in other words, it is the least distance from \\( x \\) to \\( S \\).

- If \\( x\in S \\), then \\( d(x,S)=0 \\).

> Definition. Let \\( M \\) be a metric space and let $A,B$ be subsets of $M$. Then we define the distance between the sets \\( A \\) and \\( B \\) as \\( d(A,B)=\text{inf}\{d(a,b) \ \vert \ a\in A, \ b\in B\} \\).

We will return to this more in depth at a later point.

### Isometries

> Definition. Let \\( M,N \\) be metric spaces, we say that a mapping, \\( f \\), from \\( M \\) to \\( N \\) is an isometry if
\\[ \text{for all }x,y\in M, \quad d_M(x,y)=d_N(f(x),f(y)). \\]

Examples

- Let \\( f:M\to M \\) be the identity function, then \\( f \\) is an isometry.
- Let \\( f:\mathbb{R}\to \mathbb{R} \\) be defined by \\( f(x)=-x \\), then \\( f \\) is an isometry.
