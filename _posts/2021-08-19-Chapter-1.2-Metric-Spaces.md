We will now discuss metric spaces. The word 'metric' is another way to say distance, so we may think of a metric space as a set of points with a notion of distance. What we mean by a notion of distance boils down to the existence of a function that defines a distance between any two points of the set in terms of a real number. Henceforth, we come up with the following definition:

> Definition 1.2.1 A metric space is a pair \\( (M,d) \\), where \\( M \\) is a set and \\( d:M\times M\to \mathbb{R} \\) is a function that takes in any two points of \\( M \\) and outputs a real number, since this number is meant to represent the distance between those two points, it is pertient that \\( d \\) should satisfy the following rules:
- \\( d(x,x)=0, \ \\) for any \\( x\in M. \\) 
- If \\( x,y\in M \\) and \\( d(x,y)=0 \\), then it must be that \\( x=y \\).
- \\( d(x,y)=d(y,x), \ \\) for any \\( x,y\in M. \\)
- \\( d(x,z)\leq d(x,y)+d(y,z), \ \\) for any \\( x,y,z,\in M. \\) 

If a function satisfies these rules, it is said to be a metric on \\( M \\). The third rule in particular is important, it is known as the triangle inequality.

**Example.** The set \\( \mathbb{R} \\) along with the function \\( d:\mathbb{R}^2\to \mathbb{R} \\) defined by \\( d(x,y)=\|x-y\|, \ x,y\in \mathbb{R} \\) defines a metric space. Notice that \\( d \\) represents our standard/familiar way of calculating the distance between any two real numbers. We will now verify whether or not the way we have been doing things constitutes a valid metric on \\( \mathbb{R} \\).

> Claim 1. \\( d \\) is a metric on \\( \mathbb{R} \\).

Proof. It is easy to show that \\( d \\) satsifies the first three rules, hence we will prove the triangle inequality only, i.e, we need to show that

\\[ \|x-z\|\leq \|x-y\|+\|y-z\|, \quad \text{for any }x,y,z\in M. \\]

Let us first prove the simpler, \\( \|a+b\|\leq \|a\|+\|b\|, \ a,b\in \mathbb{R}. \\) Notice that

\\[ \begin{align\*} -\|a\|&\leq a\leq \|a\| \newline -\|b\|&\leq b\leq \|b\| \end{align*} \\]

Adding gives

\\[ -(\|a\|+\|b\|)\leq a+b\leq \|a\|+\|b\| \quad \Longleftrightarrow \quad \|a+b\|\leq \|a\|+\|b\|. \\]

Now, make the substitution \\( a=x-y \\) and \\( b=y-z \\), this completes the proof. \\( \Box \\)

**Example.** Consider \\( \mathbb{R}^2 \\), we are also familiar with a method of measuring distances between points from this set. This method (metric) is derived from Pythagoras' theorem, \\( d:\mathbb{R}^2\times \mathbb{R}^2\to \mathbb{R} \\), where if \\( x=(x_1,x_2) \\) and \\( y=(y_1,y_2) \\) are arbitrary points of \\( \mathbb{R}^2 \\), then \\( d(x,y)=\sqrt{\|x_1-x_2\|^2+\|y_1-y_2\|^2} \\).

- Derive a 'familiar' metric for \\( \mathbb{R}^3 \\), generalize this to \\( \mathbb{R}^n \\)
- This 'familiar' metric for measuring distances between points of \\( \mathbb{R}^n \\) is known as the Euclidean \\(n\\)-metric. Unless otherwise specified, whenever we use/mention \\( \mathbb{R}^n \\) as a metric space, it is to be assumed that \\( \mathbb{R}^n \\) is paired with the Euclidean \\(n\\)-metric.
- We will prove that the euclidean \\(n\\)-metric satisfies the triangle inequality in a future post. For now, we will just have to be satisfied with knowing that this is true for \\( n=1 \\) (Claim 1). 

It is important to realize that it is possible for the same set to be paired up with distinct metrics. In other words, there could potentially be more than one notion of distance applied to the same set. For example, \\( d_1 \\) and \\( d_2 \\) could be two distinct metrics on \\( M \\), after pairing we obtain the different metric spaces \\( (M,d_1) \\) and \\( (M,d_2) \\), the same set of points, but a different method of measuring the distances between those points. A concrete example is given later on.

**Example.** We will provide a metric that can be paired with any arbitrary set. Let \\( M \\) be an arbitrary set, then the function defined by

\\[ d(x,y)=\begin{cases} 0 &\text{ if }x=y \newline 1 &\text{ if }x\neq y \end{cases}, \quad x,y\in M. \\]

constitutes as a metric on \\( M \\). It is known as the discrete metric. Here is a proof:

We will prove the triangle inequality only, i.e, we need to show that

\\[ d(x,z)\leq d(x,y)+d(y,z), \quad x,y,z\in M. \\]

We shall split into two cases. First assume that \\( x\neq y \\), so we need to prove that

\\[ d(x,z)\leq 1+d(y,z). \\]

This is inequality is obviously true since both \\( d(x,z) \\) and \\( d(y,z) \\) can only be either \\( 0 \\) or \\( 1 \\). Next, we assume that \\( x=y \\), this means we need to prove that

\\[ d(x,z)\leq d(y,z). \\]

The only way for this inequality to be false is if \\( d(x,z)=1 \\) and \\( d(y,z)=0 \\). This implies that \\( x\neq z \\) and \\( y=z \\), but the latter is impossible given that \\( x=y \\). \\( \Box \\)

This means that any arbitrary set can be turned into a metric space, we just need to pair it with the discrete metric. 

**Example.** Let \\( d_1 \\) denote the euclidean 1-metric and \\( d_2 \\) denote the discrete metric. Either of these can be used as a metric on \\( \mathbb{R} \\), for example, pairing \\(d_1\\) with \\( \mathbb{R} \\) gives \\( (\mathbb{R},d_1) \\), and pairing it with \\( d_2 \\) gives \\( (\mathbb{R},d_2) \\).

> When we write "Let \\( (M,d) \\) be a metric space", we mean that \\( M \\) is an arbitrary set and \\( d \\) is an arbitrary metric on \\( M \\). However, to simplify things, we shall write "Let \\( M \\) be a metric space" instead. Here, a metric is not explicitly mentioned, but we expect the reader to have a tacit understanding that some arbitrary metric \\( d \\) is available upon demand.

### Basic Theorems on Metric Spaces

> Theorem 1.2.1 If \\( M \\) is a metric space and \\( x,y\in M \\) are two distinct points, then \\( d(x,y)>0 \\).

Proof. We know \\( d(x,y) \\) cannot be equal to zero because that would imply \\( x=y \\) (rule 1), so now we only need to disprove \\( d(x,y)<0 \\). By the triangle inequality,

\\[ 0=d(x,x)\leq d(x,y)+d(y,x)=2d(x,y) \ , \\]

Therefore, it is impossible for \\( d(x,y)<0 \\). \\( \Box \\)

> Theorem 1.2.2 [Reverse Triangle Inequality] If \\( M \\) is a metric space, then 
\\[ \|d(x,z)-d(y,z)\|\leq d(x,y), \quad x,y,z\in M. \\]

Proof. By triangle inequality, 

\\[ d(x,z)\leq d(x,y)+d(y,z) \quad \Longrightarrow \quad d(x,z)-d(y,z)\leq d(x,y). \\]

Similarly,

\\[ d(y,z)\leq d(y,x)+d(x,z) \quad \Longrightarrow \quad -d(x,y)\leq d(x,z)-d(x,y). \\]

Therefore,

\\[ -d(x,y)\leq d(x,z)-d(x,y)\leq d(x,y) \quad \Longrightarrow \quad \|d(x,z)-d(x,y)\|\leq d(x,y). \quad \Box \\]

### Metric Subspaces

Given a metric space \\( (M,d) \\), any subset \\( S \\) of \\( M \\) can be turned into a metric space in its own right, this is done by pairing \\( S \\) with the restriction \\( p=d\|_{S\times S} \\). In other words, we shall choose to measure distances between points of \\( S \\) the same way we would with points in \\( (M,d) \\). The diagram below highlights the idea:

![Capture.PNG](assets/Capture.PNG)
\\[ p(x,y)=d(x,y), \quad \forall x,y\in S. \\]

It is obvious that \\( p \\) is a metric on \\( S \\), the properties satisfied by \\( d \\) simply carries over to its restriction, \\( p \\). Our point is: a metric on \\( M \\) automatically defines a metric on \\( S \\) by restriction, this metric is said to be inherited from \\( M \\), pairing this metric with \\( S \\) gives us a metric space, more specifically, this pairing results in what is known as a metric subspace of \\( M \\).

> Just to be clear, when we say something along the lines of 'Let \\( S \\) be a metric subspace of \\( M \\)', we are referring to the pairing between an arbitrary subset \\( S \\) of \\( M \\) together with an inherited metric from \\( M \\). 

**Example.** Let \\( \mathbb{N} \\) be a metric subspace of \\( \mathbb{R} \\), what do we mean by that? We are referring specifically to the pairing between \\( \mathbb{N} \\) and an inherited metric from \\( \mathbb{R} \\). If we want to be more specific, this inherited metric is the restriction \\( d\|_{\mathbb{N}\times \mathbb{N}} \\), where \\( d \\) is the euclidean 1-metric.
