The Archemedean Property states that for any real number, \\(r\\), there exists a natural number \\(n\\) such that \\(x<n\\). Although this result is most certainly true and simple, it can be derived from the basic axioms which govern the set of real numbers, \\( \mathbb{R} \\).

One of the axioms involved is known as the least upper bound property. It states that any subset of \\( \mathbb{R} \\) that is bounded above has a least upper bound. Some of these words may seem unfamiliar to you so we shall define them.

> Definition 1.1 \\( \ x\in \mathbb{R}\\) is said to be an upper bound of a subset \\( A\subseteq\mathbb{R} \\) if for all \\( a\in A\\), we have \\( a\leq x\\).
